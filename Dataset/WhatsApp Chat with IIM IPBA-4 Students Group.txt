2/8/20, 10:57 - Babi IPBA created group "IIM IPBA-4 Students Group"
2/26/20, 14:46 - Babi IPBA added you
2/26/20, 14:47 - Babi IPBA: Mazhar, Susandeep - welcome to students group
2/26/20, 14:50 - Mazhar: Hello Everyone
2/26/20, 14:51 - Mazhar: Are there any important updates if any, am I missing?
2/26/20, 15:07 - Susandeep IPBA: Hi Babi
2/26/20, 15:07 - Susandeep IPBA: I believe another group is also created for same
2/26/20, 15:41 - Babi IPBA: This group is not Jigsaw announcement. This is internal students group from this batch where we can share useful information with batch mates and help upskill, problem solving etc.
2/26/20, 15:42 - Babi IPBA: We want this group to be active and sharing useful information which can be productive and help each other in problem solving, learning, upskilling activities. Not everyone likes to be spammed with unwanted information. We certainly do not want our colleagues politely leaving this group. Let us build upon a healthy relationship.

The Golden Rules for posting on this Group

* Always keep to the purpose of the group! Don‚Äôt share irrelevant messages about other topics.

*  Do not spam the group by sending large size entertaining pictures and videos.

*  Post your message in one single chunk of text, don‚Äôt post every word or sentence in a new message.

*  Do not have one-on-one conversations in the group. Switch to private messages to connect separately on specific personal topic if any.

*  Limit your wishes to textual message where possible. We are sure, everyone will be excited to know about birthday‚Äôs, anniversary and send wishes on festive seasons.

*  If a message asks for a positive response like an RSVP, don‚Äôt reply in the negative or use harsh words. Only say if you are able to attend. Don‚Äôt double RSVP if a second call to action is sent out for the same event.

*  If someone asks a question and you don‚Äôt know the answer don‚Äôt respond with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù. Just wait for someone who knows the answer to reply.

*  Please don‚Äôt send in a hundred ‚Äúthank you‚Äù messages. If you feel gratitude towards someone ‚Äì tell them in a private message.

*  If someone asks a question of a personal nature (like asking for advice) don‚Äôt respond if someone else has already answered, or else respond to the person directly in a private message.

*  The group is not a political. No arguing, no heated opinions, no fear mongering, no hyped up drama, no fake news. Check your sources before you share.

*  Never EVER use this group to berate someone else or air grievances. If you have an issue address it one on one with the relevant person

*  Don‚Äôt send data-insensitive messages. No-one wants their last 3GB used up on uninvited memes.

If you are not sure, ask yourself these three questions before you post:
1.    Is this relevant?
2.    Is this necessary?
3.    Is this a good time to post?
2/26/20, 16:32 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Most of us might think that data scientist spend most of their time in building machine learning algorithm, coding, data analysis but it's other way round
2/26/20, 16:32 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: <Media omitted>
2/26/20, 16:33 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: 80% is spent in data collection, cleaning, organising and preparing the data for ML models
2/26/20, 16:35 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: So, it's very important we spend most of our time understanding the domain, business source of data and which data is relevant for us...
2/26/20, 16:47 - Srikanth IPBA: Interesting pie diagram. Any idea if we have the option to use data sets from a specific domain for the mini projects/capstone? I did not get a convincing answer from them
2/26/20, 16:49 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: Depends
2/26/20, 16:49 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: I think they will give us a domain to choose and then we should get specific datasets
2/26/20, 16:50 - Srikanth IPBA: Great üëç
2/26/20, 16:58 - Srikanth IPBA: To add to what you have written earlier, there seems to be lot of confusion with regards to the key differences between data scientist/business analyst/data analyst/business intelligence etc, probably an outcome of HR dept‚Äôs misadventures. Here‚Äôs a pic that neatly summarises each one of these profiles
2/26/20, 16:58 - Srikanth IPBA: <Media omitted>
2/26/20, 17:04 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Yes, to explain it in a simpler form in below Venn diagram
2/26/20, 17:04 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: <Media omitted>
2/26/20, 17:04 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: So Data Science is the intersection of all
2/26/20, 17:11 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: Sudhir bro I just going to finish my bcom and I code to do this course and become an business analyst what all should I study to stay on the race?
2/26/20, 17:11 - Babi IPBA: There are public data sets made available by Google on cloud.google.com
2/26/20, 17:14 - Srikanth IPBA: Thanks!
2/26/20, 17:14 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: To add to this .....
If we talk about different roles in Data Science based on the intersections they would beüëá
Domain expertise and computer science by Data Engineers
Domain Expertise and Mathematics by Data Analyst
Mathematics and Computer Science by 
Researchers/ Scientists developing new algorithms
Therefore being a Data Analyst or Business  Analyst we need to have the domain expertise also...
So this could be a challenge for those trying to switch their domain of work...
2/26/20, 17:16 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Yes , Domain knowledge is extremely important ...else you can't prepare the data for ur ML models ...this data feature engineering is tedious job
2/26/20, 17:32 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Coming to ur profile and to complete this course, go through statistics covering all kinds of regression, classification and cluster ling techniques, then u need to learn R it Python to design Ur ML models....u just need to basic coding as both these languages provide solid ML packages to get good accuracies on ur models. Most important and tedious task is to clean the data, fill the missing values, prepare a proper training dataset based on which ur test models will work
2/26/20, 17:33 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: It's a very large field and it needs lots of enthusiasm and passion to excel
2/26/20, 17:34 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Growth is unlimited
2/26/20, 17:34 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: We really don't have enough skilled professional s who can solve real business problems
2/26/20, 18:22 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: As per latest glass door report, Data science jobs continue s to remain the most sought after and highly paid jobs and the number of vacancies are increasing year on year due to lack up enough skilled professionals
2/26/20, 18:39 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: I think the salaries are good for those who are freshers...like just coming out of college or has worked for only 2-3 years
But i am sure many of us would already be on some mid senior level... where salaries are considerably more than entry level...
Can anyone comment on that..!!
2/26/20, 18:44 - Saroj Ex IPBA: Agreed
2/26/20, 18:46 - Saroj Ex IPBA: We need to gain some experience in data science by means of capstone projects or moving to data science team internally
2/26/20, 18:46 - Saroj Ex IPBA: Then we can modify our resume completely a data science centric resume
2/26/20, 18:53 - Saroj Ex IPBA: If there is no opportunity to move internally within same organisation then we can portray the capstone projects in resume and anyways IIM certificate would also help to get a new job with expected Ctc
2/26/20, 18:54 - Srikanth IPBA: kaggle competitions will boost the resume further
2/26/20, 18:56 - Saroj Ex IPBA: Let me tell you guys, I don‚Äôt know abcd of programming, neither any knowledge about data science
2/26/20, 18:58 - Saroj Ex IPBA: But i have an opportunity to switch within org if I demonstrate that I learned data science and completed this course
2/26/20, 19:00 - Srikanth IPBA: More than programming, a solid foundation in mathematics and statistical techniques complemented with good analytical skills will greatly aid in your pursuit.
2/26/20, 19:00 - Saroj Ex IPBA: üëç
2/26/20, 19:02 - Srikanth IPBA: If you have time, take a basic course on python and SQL on udemy before the classes commence. Coding is not rocket science if you precisely know what to code
2/26/20, 19:02 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Both Python and sql is very easy to learn....
2/26/20, 19:10 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: Can anyone help me I have finished core java, sql, python and going to finish my bcom is it enough and which companies will hire me and how will I get it to business analytics
2/26/20, 19:11 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: U can try in Amazon
2/26/20, 19:12 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: But the vacancies are only for engineer background students
2/26/20, 19:12 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: And I am a commerce stream student
2/26/20, 19:13 - Bharat IPBA: It depends on knowledge you gain in data science
2/26/20, 19:13 - Bharat IPBA: Also
2/26/20, 19:13 - Gaurav Pramod IPBA: Can someone recommend good sites or portal to learn basic sql and python?
2/26/20, 19:13 - Gaurav Pramod IPBA: Before commencing this program

3/3/20, 19:06 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: Hello, I'm Laila Ahmadi from China, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Zanjan University
  Corona virus arrives in any country, sooner or later there is no doubt that many countries have no diagnostic sets or equipment, so
  Please use as much as possible of natural vitamin C to strengthen your immune system.
  Don't worry, C gets rid of it a lot, and it's fine.
  Also make sure to use more yellow wood
  In addition,
  Tell yourself and your children that they are all supposed to be HIV-positive and don't touch anyone or regret it.
  The virus currently contains no vaccine and no specific treatment
  Unfortunately, due to the genetic mutation that made it very dangerous
  This disease appears to be caused by gene fusion in a snake and bat, and it has acquired the ability to infect mammals, including humans.

It is important to keep the message on your greatest knowledge: Professor Chen Horin, CEO of the Beijing Military Hospital, said: "Slices of lemon in a cup of lukewarm water can save your life."  *
   Even if you work, you should take a look at this message and pass it on to others!  Hot lemon can kill cancer cells!  The lemon cut into three parts and put in a cup, then pour hot water and turn it into (alkaline water), drinking it every day will certainly benefit everyone.  Hot lemons can release the anti-cancer drug again.  Hot lemon juice appeared on cancerous tumors and cured all cancers.
  Treatment with this extract only destroys malignant cells and does not affect healthy cells.
  Second: the acids and carboxylic acid contained in lemon juice can regulate high blood pressure, protect narrow arteries, regulate blood circulation and reduce blood clotting.
  After reading, talk to someone else and transfer it to the person you love and take care of your personal health.
  Council:
  Professor Chen Horin notes that anyone who receives this message is at least guaranteed to save someone's life...
  I have done my job and I hope you can help me develop it as well.
 They published it in academic groups
3/3/20, 19:12 - Saroj Ex IPBA: üëç
3/3/20, 20:29 - Vinayak Ex IPBA: Travel not the best idea right now
3/3/20, 21:57 - Susandeep IPBA: <Media omitted>
3/3/20, 22:05 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: We just heard of Delhi, Bangalore , Indore etc as these patients are medically diagnosed but these virus might be there in other cities and it's not yet medically diagnosed. We just need to take care of as much precautions as possible....
3/3/20, 22:14 - Dinesh IPBA: Probably IIM and Jigsaw should think on alternate
3/3/20, 22:25 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: But people are traveling through flights and trains across all cities. There is no ban on any kind of travel...I am just thinking even if we don't travel still there is a chance that it might catch us if someone else is traveling from other cities to our resident cities though chances will be less....
3/3/20, 22:42 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: https://youtu.be/g9dlaJV1TXg
3/3/20, 22:44 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Plz do watch this video on Corona virus. It's just another flu like virus and nothing new....it will cause sickness to u only if ur immunity is low . But take precautions and maintain healthy lifestyle to have astrong immunity
3/3/20, 22:45 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: A very informative and useful video....
3/3/20, 22:53 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: It's the same way you catch cold n cough and become sick because of low immunity but nothing happens to u if u HV a strong immunity
3/3/20, 22:54 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: So old and kids are more susceptible to these viruses because of low immunity
3/3/20, 22:59 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Infact I am traveling officially to Kolkata this weekend for a recruitment drive. Nothing to panic but to take precautionary measure ....
3/4/20, 01:36 - Saroj Ex IPBA: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/
3/4/20, 01:37 - Saroj Ex IPBA: Use worldometers to stay updated
3/4/20, 07:37 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: According to WHO stats, almost 10 millions get infected every year with Mycobacterium tuberculosis which causes TB and almost 1.5 million people dies every year which is very alarming and the numbers are very large as compared to Corona Virus. But nobody speaks about. I hope that you understand what I mean to say...
3/4/20, 07:47 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: As long as ur immunity is strong nothing will happen to you let it be TB, Corona or HIV ....infact there are many more infectious virus or bactearia which are killing people every year ....these infections will be life threatening only if our immunity is not strong enough to fight the sickness......world most complex, sophisticated, most advanced defense system is our own immuno system provided we support it with right  nutrition, exercise, healthy lifestyle and all....nothing to panic....
3/4/20, 08:05 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: World's 2 leading causes of death is Heart diseases and Cancer. Both these diseases are induced by our poor and stressful lifestyle, poor nutrition, lack of exercise and not able to manage the stress. We all have cancer cells but it will be detected under a microscope biospy only if it grows to certain threshold limit. This growth of cancerous tumor happens only if we have weakening immunity system due to poor lifestyle, stress, over toxicating our body with stress or food items. Every cancer and heart diseases are absolutely preventable except few which happens due to DNA disorders...if u try understand....we all are creating these diseases and then bringing out medical solutions to treat these diseases. Billions of dollars are spent in treating these diseases every year. I see people just don't have enough knowledge about their own health...ur health is in in your hand...
3/4/20, 13:49 - Saroj Ex IPBA: Bases on voice of people see now we are on poll
3/4/20, 13:49 - Saroj Ex IPBA: There should be a pole for jigsaw logo in certification as well
3/4/20, 13:50 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Yes, we should vouch for a voting for removal of Jigsaw logo
3/4/20, 13:50 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: They will hear our voice
3/4/20, 19:24 - Babi IPBA: Hello everyone,
I am sure everyone might have responded to poll and there has been difference in opinions of individuals and i seeing lot of posts here.

Given the safety and sudden rise in number of cases, I request everyone to step back and think again. Govt have issued travel advisory and mass connect yo help control this virus. Those who are working professional like me might have already seen updates from organizations and I am sure IIM will adhere to code of conduct if there are any instructions or so. 
I am sure everyone is excited to visit IIM and connect with each other. However we can always have that connect down the line. Everyone ows equal responsibility towards community to combat and help prevent spread of this virus.

Please think again once and then decide. We still have time and dont know the impact of this over the coming days. Prevention is better than cure.
3/4/20, 19:35 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Yes Babi ...I agree prevention is better than cure ....we all go to office and eat in a canteen and attend townhalls in a gathering, go for team engagement activities in a mass. I have folks in my team who have travelled from Delhi, Kolkata, Bihar, Assam, Chennai and they work in my team and I work with them daily basis. U can't avoid this as I have to work in office with my team. There is a chance that these travelled team members might spread virus but I can't stop them coming to office. Holi  holidays are coming. Folks are traveling to their and will come back and resume work next week.
3/4/20, 19:44 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: We have a recruitment drive in Kolkata this Saturday. Recruitment panelists are travelling from all metro cities to Kolkata including myself. I asked my HR , are we cancelling this recruitment drive due to Corona virus , they replied it's business as usual, we all have to travel Kolkata as lot of planning has been done and many folks are coming for the interview. Chances are there I might catch virus but I can't avoid being an official travel
3/4/20, 19:45 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: What I mean to say there are certain scenarios we cannot avoid but yes we have to take precautions
3/4/20, 20:01 - Lakshminarayan IPBA: My organisation ( its a global organisation) located in hard core virus suspected area in india. But there is no such travel ban or advise issue by organization. Let individual take the decision. Please dont insist anything.
3/4/20, 20:55 - Vinayak Ex IPBA: Personal choice but I think convocation more important than inauguration so if one feels like shouldnt attend can take that call not much lost
3/4/20, 21:10 - Lakshminarayan IPBA: People living in india knows better whats happening in india and the reality. They know whats important in their life. Nobody willing to risk their life. Whats the relationship between travelling out and convocation. So no one shouldnt leave their house, stay in home until the issues are resolved.
3/4/20, 21:36 - Vinayak Ex IPBA: Convications are what people dont like to miss is all am saying
3/4/20, 21:36 - Vinayak Ex IPBA: Also I said personal choice
3/4/20, 21:36 - Vinayak Ex IPBA: So if you feel like you can travel you should
3/5/20, 06:45 - Lakshminarayan IPBA: Thats your view, some people like to attend both , some people may not attend. That depends on their choice and situtaion. And IIM attendance also shows 80 to 90 % for inperson session. Personal choice  Statement shouldnt impose anything and shouldnt create fear. People are mature enough to take decision depends on the situtaion.
3/5/20, 08:02 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Just to give an an example, currently, all IIMs are conducting interviews for the newly selected CAT scores to take fresh admissions. 2 of my team members travelled to Calcutta to attend the interview s and they came back. Many other colleges are doing in all metro cities. There is no cancellation of any event or any travel plans by anybody.
3/5/20, 08:46 - Babi IPBA: Individually one should access the situation and take their own call. No hype or panicking but stay healthy and safe.
3/5/20, 09:01 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: üëç

3/5/20, 11:06 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: I have 1 query regarding this course, the eligibility criteria is that we should be graduate s with 50% marks with valid CAT/GMAT/Jigsaw aptitude score with minimum 1 year work experience. Does Jigsaw or IIM has asked for certification it work experience validation so far to anybody? Because they have not yet asked me regarding this.
3/5/20, 11:07 - Manasi IPBA: No. No such verification has been asked for. Just the resume .
3/5/20, 11:08 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Yes, correct. But as mentioned in IIM portal these are the prerequisites. And being a premier institution, it should happen before commencement of the course
3/5/20, 11:10 - Saroj Ex IPBA: At the time of selection, IIM selection committee has already taken these documents
3/5/20, 11:11 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: They have not yet asked any documents to me. I just shared my profile and my GMAT score then followed up by a personal I terview with IIM
3/5/20, 11:11 - Saroj Ex IPBA: Oh
3/5/20, 11:12 - Saroj Ex IPBA: I went thru complete process of selection
3/5/20, 11:12 - Saroj Ex IPBA: After checking the documents, they finalised the offer
3/5/20, 11:13 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Ok...for me, it was my professional profile in linked in and my resume, GMAT score and interview
3/5/20, 11:13 - Archana IPBA: Wat document

3/5/20, 11:23 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: They also told that u have to work hard as I am not an computer science student and don‚Äôt have work experience
3/5/20, 11:24 - Saroj Ex IPBA: Although i have 10 + years of experience, still i am a novice to technical stuffs
3/5/20, 11:24 - Saroj Ex IPBA: Even i have to work hard .. else FAIL üò±üòÇ
3/5/20, 11:25 - Archana IPBA: Ok

3/5/20, 11:27 - Saroj Ex IPBA: Can we discuss about it
3/5/20, 11:27 - Saroj Ex IPBA: I am completely lost, cannot understand anything
3/5/20, 11:28 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: That statistics stuff is boring...we really don't need to know so much
3/5/20, 11:28 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Some basic statistics is enough
3/5/20, 11:28 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: All kinds of regression, classification, association etc is enogh
3/5/20, 11:29 - Saroj Ex IPBA: Can you pls help me and let me know what main topics I should study
3/5/20, 11:29 - Saroj Ex IPBA: I am scared actually bcz after office hardly i get time and no energy to study after hectic schedule in office
3/5/20, 11:30 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Don't get scared...it will be smooth....just get ur basics clear on statistics
3/5/20, 11:30 - Saroj Ex IPBA: And Note - I am completely new to technical things. Need to start from basics of programming, basics of statistics etc
3/5/20, 11:31 - Saroj Ex IPBA: You are from techie background?
3/5/20, 11:43 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Yes..hard core technical Computer science background
3/5/20, 11:43 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: But the way this course is designed...basic technical knowledge required
3/5/20, 11:44 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Basic statistics basic coding knowledge
3/5/20, 11:47 - Lakshminarayan IPBA: For basic data analysis, simple python and sql is enough to extract and process data set. Cloud platforms providing feature that applies all the algorithm , thats helps us to find the closest model to fit for the requirement.
3/5/20, 11:47 - Lakshminarayan IPBA: But deep learning needs lots of technical knowledge.
3/5/20, 11:47 - Lakshminarayan IPBA: But cleaning the data is very important, and interest and knowledege on statistics and maths is important for data science.
3/5/20, 11:47 - Lakshminarayan IPBA: At last we should know how to apply domain knowledge and how to read the data/output , interpret the output for decision making also important.
3/5/20, 11:49 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: This part is known as feature engineering and you will be spending almost 60% time here
3/5/20, 11:52 - Saroj Ex IPBA: One question- Can I complete this course.. ? I doubt hahah..
3/5/20, 11:53 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: You have to spend time in weekends atleast 12 hours and weekdays 3-6 hours
3/5/20, 11:53 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Including IIM trainings
3/5/20, 11:53 - Saroj Ex IPBA: Ok
3/5/20, 11:53 - Saroj Ex IPBA: For a complete beginner?
3/5/20, 11:53 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Yes
3/5/20, 11:54 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: It's enough
3/5/20, 11:54 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: To get the certification
3/5/20, 11:54 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA: Not to become a full fledged data scientist or business analytics professional
3/5/20, 11:54 - Saroj Ex IPBA: Ok
3/5/20, 11:56 - Sandy IPBA: Guys, just a small humble  request, if it's one to one discussion could we do it as PM. Sorry but the phone keeps buzzing during calls and meetings.  PM -Not to offend anyone or to take personally. Thanks.
3/5/20, 12:05 - Saroj Ex IPBA: Sure sandeep. We will keep in mind. This is a students group, we can discuss n‚Äô number of topics related to this course however if it is 1-1 we will try to avoid in this group.
3/5/20, 12:10 - Babi IPBA: Just a reminder. Sharing these rules of posting
3/5/20, 12:10 - Babi IPBA: We want this group to be active and sharing useful information which can be productive and help each other in problem solving, learning, upskilling activities. Not everyone likes to be spammed with unwanted information. We certainly do not want our colleagues politely leaving this group. Let us build upon a healthy relationship.

The Golden Rules for posting on this Group

* Always keep to the purpose of the group! Don‚Äôt share irrelevant messages about other topics.

*  Do not spam the group by sending large size entertaining pictures and videos.

*  Post your message in one single chunk of text, don‚Äôt post every word or sentence in a new message.

*  Do not have one-on-one conversations in the group. Switch to private messages to connect separately on specific personal topic if any.

*  Limit your wishes to textual message where possible. We are sure, everyone will be excited to know about birthday‚Äôs, anniversary and send wishes on festive seasons.

*  If a message asks for a positive response like an RSVP, don‚Äôt reply in the negative or use harsh words. Only say if you are able to attend. Don‚Äôt double RSVP if a second call to action is sent out for the same event.

*  If someone asks a question and you don‚Äôt know the answer don‚Äôt respond with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù. Just wait for someone who knows the answer to reply.

*  Please don‚Äôt send in a hundred ‚Äúthank you‚Äù messages. If you feel gratitude towards someone ‚Äì tell them in a private message.

*  If someone asks a question of a personal nature (like asking for advice) don‚Äôt respond if someone else has already answered, or else respond to the person directly in a private message.

*  The group is not a political. No arguing, no heated opinions, no fear mongering, no hyped up drama, no fake news. Check your sources before you share.

*  Never EVER use this group to berate someone else or air grievances. If you have an issue address it one on one with the relevant person

*  Don‚Äôt send data-insensitive messages. No-one wants their last 3GB used up on uninvited memes.

If you are not sure, ask yourself these three questions before you post:
1.    Is this relevant?
2.    Is this necessary?
3.    Is this a good time to post?
3/5/20, 12:11 - Babi IPBA: I request everyone to read and adhere

3/5/20, 19:32 - Babi IPBA changed this group's settings to allow only admins to send messages to this group
3/5/20, 20:59 - Babi IPBA: Folks, apologies but I have to suspend any posting temporary. Inspite of setting up rules for posting there is hardly any adherence. I understand there are concerns. Please raise any such with Jigsaw IIM team. I have seen group flooded with messages which are which are not aligning to how we want move this group forward in learning and sharing knowledge. I will open up posting once we settled down. Hope everyone understands and co-operates.

3/21/20, 12:58 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Moses, where can we find the class date_ faculty name zip file?
3/21/20, 13:02 - Akansha Jain IPBA: This is students only group.Moses is not on this group
3/21/20, 13:03 - Rahul IPBA: Hi what is your name. What is your domain background.. you need to do bit hard work. As there wil be lot's of technical word  coming on the way. I believe it's not so difficult. You definitely can do it.
3/21/20, 13:05 - Avi IPBA: Session was good, it's just I feel we should have some form wherein we can write chat our questions back to professor one o one and he can come back to us when he gets time. Not sure if this facility is available already

3/21/20, 13:05 - Durga Ex IPBA: Usually there is something called Discussion board and emails
3/21/20, 13:05 - Rahul IPBA: You can note down all the questions. Email them. One of faculty will get back to you.. this is one of the process

3/21/20, 13:07 - Chandrika IPBA: if they have audio open in the end for questions, that will be helpful

3/21/20, 13:08 - Chandrika IPBA: they can keep sometime for questions in the end instead of chat
3/21/20, 13:08 - Rahul IPBA: Chandrika, you can ask them to open your audio.  They will be doing it. Enabling audio of all 68 people at time will create disturbance and noise...
3/21/20, 13:08 - Chandrika IPBA: ok
3/21/20, 13:09 - Durga Ex IPBA: I believe prof mention that we may get chance to ask questions for special requests

3/21/20, 13:09 - Chandrika IPBA: that will be good
3/21/20, 13:09 - Rahul IPBA: Yeah. Ping on chat. To enable audio. They will do it. Then can discuss with them further

3/23/20, 19:10 - Neerav IPBA: For them it could be an yearly thing but we cannot give more than a year to this so we gotta make it count . You can drop emails to the support team of jigsaw
3/23/20, 19:10 - Neerav IPBA: They do respond
3/23/20, 19:11 - Kajal IPBA: Got it

3/23/20, 19:18 - Rahul IPBA: They do take feedback very seriously. And try to come with the best possible way.
3/23/20, 19:21 - Sanchit IPBA: I have spoke with couple of guys from their Batch 2 which is still going on, they told me that they take continuous feedback and also improve the things accordingly. So I think it's worth to give them the feedback

3/24/20, 13:08 - Babi IPBA: A Gentle Reminder to everyone

As a admin, I just thought of sharing this. We want this group to be active and sharing useful information which can be productive and help each other in learning, upskilling activities. Not everyone likes to be spammed with unwanted information. We certainly do not want our colleagues politely leaving this group. Let us build upon a healthy relationship.

The Golden Rules for posting on this Group

* Always keep to the purpose of the group! Don‚Äôt share irrelevant messages about other topics.

*  Do not spam the group by sending large size entertaining pictures and videos.

*  Post your message in one single chunk of text, don‚Äôt post every word or sentence in a new message.

*  Do not have one-on-one conversations in the group. Switch to private messages to connect separately on specific personal topic if any.

*  Limit your wishes to textual message where possible. We are sure, everyone will be excited to know about birthday‚Äôs, anniversary and send wishes on festive seasons.

*  If a message asks for a positive response like an RSVP, don‚Äôt reply in the negative or use harsh words. Only say if you are able to attend. Don‚Äôt double RSVP if a second call to action is sent out for the same event.

*  If someone asks a question and you don‚Äôt know the answer don‚Äôt respond with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù. Just wait for someone who knows the answer to reply.

*  Please don‚Äôt send in a hundred ‚Äúthank you‚Äù messages. If you feel gratitude towards someone ‚Äì tell them in a private message.

*  If someone asks a question of a personal nature (like asking for advice) don‚Äôt respond if someone else has already answered, or else respond to the person directly in a private message.

*  The group is not a political. No arguing, no heated opinions, no fear mongering, no hyped up drama, no fake news. Check your sources before you share.

*  Never EVER use this group to berate someone else or air grievances. If you have an issue address it one on one with the relevant person

*  Don‚Äôt send data-insensitive messages. No-one wants their last 3GB used up on uninvited memes.

If you are not sure, ask yourself these three questions before you post:
1.    Is this relevant?
2.    Is this necessary?
3.    Is this a good time to post?

3/24/20, 16:44 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: https://www.covidvisualizer.com/
3/24/20, 16:45 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: üëÜA good Data Visualisation technique....
3/24/20, 18:27 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: These are fake and this kind of websites will make u more vulnerable to get an internet hack or torjan attack
3/24/20, 18:29 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: Even Microsoft is finding it hard to figure out such vishualizer so stay safe from corona and online such stuff
3/24/20, 18:57 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Thanks... A good point to consider...
But why ‚Äò Microsoft is struggling‚Äô for such simple visualiser.. This is a very simple one and the website even gives the refence of data updates...
3/24/20, 19:02 - Mazhar: I agree, there is no way Microsoft or any tech company would struggle to create such a visualizer.

The difficult aspect of maintaining such a website would be regular data updation, data validation, traffic management and others

3/28/20, 17:39 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Same thing is happening with me also... everything is alright..not a single error but output is coming... I restarted the jupyter and it worked but after some time again the same thing is happening
3/28/20, 17:39 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: I think we t missing something here...
3/28/20, 17:39 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: Can you share the screen shot
3/28/20, 17:40 - Rahul IPBA: Guys, rename the path of your data to reduce complexity. It will be easy for understanding.
3/28/20, 17:40 - Neerav IPBA: Oh yeah I remember now . It will load the sheet once you call it separately üôà
3/28/20, 17:40 - Rahul IPBA: Anyone else getting error whole loading?
3/28/20, 17:40 - Girish Kumar: But I am getting an error
3/28/20, 17:40 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: ok its working now

3/28/20, 17:44 - Rahul IPBA: Code is fine
3/28/20, 17:45 - Rahul IPBA: May be your credit_data cell is not executing
3/28/20, 17:49 - Girish Kumar: Is there anything I can do about it?
3/28/20, 17:51 - Rahul IPBA: Executive initialisation cell again.
3/28/20, 17:51 - Guru Ex IPBA left
3/28/20, 17:58 - Girish Kumar: Tried not working

3/28/20, 18:21 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: I got it
3/28/20, 18:27 - Girish Kumar: I got it . Thanks to Manasi
3/28/20, 21:37 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: <Media omitted>
3/28/20, 21:37 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: But if i dont seperate them then jupyter is working fine....
3/28/20, 21:39 - Akansha Jain IPBA: Select the entire sheet and try to wrap the text
3/28/20, 21:42 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Nah not happing... but surprisingly jupyter is taking them as separate coloumns and excel in single coloum
3/28/20, 21:42 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: It‚Äôs because
3/28/20, 21:43 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: If you import it as csv file which stands for comma separated files
3/28/20, 21:43 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: So a , means a new column
3/28/20, 21:43 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: So Jupyter will read them as different col.
3/28/20, 21:43 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Where as excel is an data entry platform
3/28/20, 21:44 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: So excel would be reading it the way you will type it
3/28/20, 21:44 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Or the way you have entered the data
3/28/20, 21:44 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: I hope you understand what I‚Äôm trying to say
3/28/20, 21:45 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Ya got it...thanks...
3/28/20, 21:45 - Manasi IPBA: @918200442931  you will have to change settings for your excel in the data tab.
3/28/20, 21:45 - Manasi IPBA: Give delimiter as comma.
3/28/20, 21:46 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Ya i did... thats when jupyter stops reading then as separate coloums....
3/28/20, 21:50 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Ya its working now... dont know why but working...Thanks
3/28/20, 21:53 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: <Media omitted>
3/28/20, 21:54 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: <Media omitted>
3/28/20, 21:55 - Manasi IPBA: üòê
3/28/20, 21:59 - Babi IPBA: Quick tip for those not strong with excel.
Use menu - file- open to open the csv file to curtail this kind of issue. If you double click the file to open in excel it will open in one single column. You then have to do Text to columns using comma as a delimeter. Csv file is nothing but a plain text file with dat separted by comma. Python will always read as comma separated while you provide .csv in the path. üëç
3/29/20, 14:03 - Babi IPBA: If anyone has left this course or have moved to different batch, I request them to raise their hand so that I remove them from this group. Alternatively, they can also leave the group as this group is only dedicated for batch-4 students. Thank you üôè

3/29/20, 16:11 - Sakshi IPBA: I ll check
3/29/20, 16:11 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: No problem
3/29/20, 16:12 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: https://jigsawacademy.net/courses/636/modules/6474/show
3/29/20, 16:12 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Here is the link to it
3/29/20, 16:12 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: For your convince
3/29/20, 16:15 - Sakshi IPBA: Thankuüòä
3/29/20, 17:35 - Dinesh IPBA: Guys, is there a option to download recording session? Or we can only watch online?
3/29/20, 18:01 - Rajashekhar IPBA: If you have snagit, you can record on your own
3/29/20, 18:02 - Dr Kalyan Parimi IPBA: <Media omitted>
3/29/20, 18:03 - Dr Kalyan Parimi IPBA: This has just the steps for initiating a project and rowing till the end of it. Don't expect whole code to be present.
3/29/20, 18:22 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Same question again, does anyone know how to delete all the columns from the original file using drop?
3/29/20, 18:23 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Why would you want to drop all columns ??
3/29/20, 18:24 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Just drop the dataframe
3/29/20, 18:24 - Amit Chopra IPBA: I mean specific columns
3/29/20, 18:25 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Like 2,3 columns
3/29/20, 18:33 - Ritu Batra IPBA: CreditData.drop([‚Äòcol1‚Äô, ‚Äòcol2‚Äô], axis=1)
3/29/20, 18:36 - Sudhir Kumar Das Ex IPBA left
3/29/20, 18:36 - Avinash IPBA: Can any one please share the code on sorting value with ascending condition
3/29/20, 18:40 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: Dataframe.sort_values(['column1','column2'],ascending=True/False)
3/29/20, 19:16 - Avinash IPBA: This message was deleted
3/29/20, 19:16 - Avinash IPBA: Thanks
3/29/20, 19:22 - Rajashekhar IPBA: The syntax being case sensitive is a real pain
3/29/20, 19:26 - Sanchit IPBA: Can anyone pls confirm that the only diff. b/w a Series & Dataframe that a Series has always one column whereas Dataframe has multiple columns ?

Because when I am importing csv whenever I am fetching more than one column from csv the type is automatically converting from series to dataframe. Is this some issue or am I missing something here. Please confirm. Thanks !
3/29/20, 19:32 - Srikanth IPBA: Dataframe is a collection of multiple series. Extract one column from a dataframe and check it's data type. It'll show series
3/29/20, 19:38 - Sanchit IPBA: Thanks for replying. Yeah it is showing type as series. But when I am adding second column while doing read_csv using usecols the type is converting to dataframe
3/29/20, 19:40 - Sanchit IPBA: So I think pandas decide that your type will be dataframe or series based on the no. Of columns present in ur csv
3/29/20, 19:40 - Srikanth IPBA: Yes. That's right
3/29/20, 19:41 - Sanchit IPBA: Ok. Thanks again for clearing it
3/29/20, 19:41 - Sanchit IPBA: üëçüèªüëçüèª
3/29/20, 19:59 - Surupa IPBA: Dataframe.sort_value(['column1','column2' ], ascending=False)
3/29/20, 20:01 - Dinesh IPBA: did we get any update on this?
3/29/20, 20:01 - Surupa IPBA: There is no need to write ascending =True. It will by default take in descending order
3/30/20, 21:26 - Amit Chopra IPBA: <Media omitted>
3/30/20, 21:26 - Amit Chopra IPBA: <Media omitted>
3/30/20, 21:33 - Kafeel IPBA: That just showing view its not stored in data frame store in data frams 
Customers = customers.dropna(subset = [ ‚Äò company‚Äô , ‚Äòemail‚Äô])
3/30/20, 21:34 - Kafeel IPBA: As your dropna is not stored back so the dataframe is not modified
3/30/20, 21:35 - Kafeel IPBA: Either use this or use this 

customers.dropna(subset = [ ‚Äò company‚Äô , ‚Äòemail‚Äô] ,inplace = True )
3/30/20, 21:39 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Thanks a lot üòä
3/31/20, 18:45 - Romita IPBA: Guys do we have notebook shared by Jitendra ?
3/31/20, 18:45 - Romita IPBA: Is it on jigsaw portal ?
3/31/20, 18:47 - Rahul IPBA: Please check your email. Moses emailed us.
3/31/20, 18:53 - Siddharth IPBA: The codes were shared on mail
3/31/20, 18:55 - Romita IPBA: Ok thank-you
3/31/20, 18:59 - Siddharth IPBA: Ur wc
4/1/20, 01:47 - Neerav IPBA: customers_data.query ('AGE<=25' , 'AGE GROUP') = 'YOUNG' . using the query method we cant assign the age group or is there something wrong with syntax ?
4/1/20, 01:48 - Neerav IPBA: SyntaxError: can't assign to function call
4/1/20, 07:24 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Customer_data.query(‚ÄòAGE<=25 and AGE_GROUP==‚ÄúYOUNG‚Äù) try this
4/1/20, 07:25 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Do you want to filter out people where age is less equal to 25 and age group equals to young, right?
4/1/20, 07:27 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Though, I‚Äôm not in front of my laptop
4/1/20, 08:40 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: This message was deleted
4/1/20, 11:24 - Diti IPBA: Any mail received for pre lecture video for coming weekend?
4/1/20, 11:28 - Mazhar: No email received, but the class topics are statistics based.
So watch the probablity distribution videos, Central Limit Theorem, etc
4/1/20, 11:39 - Rajashekhar IPBA: I have hard time understanding flow of this site
4/1/20, 11:39 - Rajashekhar IPBA: So the pre class videos are set on topic wise
4/1/20, 11:40 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Or chronological sequence
4/1/20, 11:40 - Rajashekhar IPBA: ??
4/1/20, 11:41 - Neerav IPBA: I have tried this
4/1/20, 11:41 - Neerav IPBA: Does not work
4/1/20, 11:41 - Neerav IPBA: Also I think query is for calling out conditions and not for assignment . Still gonna clarify though .
4/1/20, 11:49 - Diti IPBA: Ok
4/1/20, 11:50 - Neerav IPBA: Also doubl equal is for calling a condition
4/1/20, 11:50 - Neerav IPBA: Checking*
4/1/20, 12:15 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Let me check
4/1/20, 12:16 - Neerav IPBA: The result is different , this won‚Äôt assign the age group as young but will check for it .
4/1/20, 12:26 - Mazhar: Topicwise
4/1/20, 12:36 - Manasi IPBA: Hello neerav
4/1/20, 12:36 - Manasi IPBA: Query is to be given in double quotes
4/1/20, 12:36 - Manasi IPBA: Also the bracket should be closed after the complete query
4/1/20, 12:49 - Adarsh Baluapuri: Can anyone please help me with where were the codes for the case study were sent ?
4/1/20, 12:50 - Amit Chopra IPBA: That code was sent on our emails
4/1/20, 13:18 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: <Media omitted>
4/1/20, 13:19 - Siddharth IPBA: Its supposed to be
4/1/20, 13:19 - Siddharth IPBA: S=[] if u are trying to declare an emty list
4/1/20, 13:20 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: S=[]
4/1/20, 13:20 - Siddharth IPBA: *empty
4/1/20, 13:20 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: You can see it says its an syntax error right ie you are doing one grammer mistake.
4/1/20, 13:21 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: You can easily google these problems as well
4/1/20, 13:21 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: ok
4/1/20, 13:21 - Siddharth IPBA: Just put a ‚Äú =‚Äú between S and square brackets
4/1/20, 13:24 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: Sorry but you can always opt for not answering..
4/1/20, 13:32 - Neerav IPBA: I think what he meant was that it will help you üòÖ . As most time coders end up googling errors whenever they get stuck .
4/1/20, 13:33 - Neerav IPBA: That way you can address the problem yourself and the next time have a fair idea as to where to look exactly if you get stuck . Identifying the problem is key and the solution there after üòÑ
4/1/20, 15:45 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Ah you totally got the wrong idea.
I‚Äôm always ready to help but just wanted to float the idea that of you try googling and trying to check for the errors yourself and correct them then you might remember it.
In programming it‚Äôs always advised to use hit and try method to run.
Sorry if you got the wrong idea
4/1/20, 15:46 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: cool..
4/1/20, 15:49 - Mazhar: <Media omitted>
4/1/20, 15:52 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Thanks a lotüòä

4/1/20, 16:17 - Ankit Jain IPBA: hi friends ..
I just want to understand as per JLC modules we have covered first 3 modules in class or little more
4/1/20, 16:17 - Ankit Jain IPBA: for python
4/1/20, 16:20 - Mazhar: <Media omitted>
4/1/20, 16:20 - Mazhar: We've completed 3 modules in Python
4/1/20, 16:20 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Do we have any graded assignments yet
4/1/20, 16:21 - Mazhar: Not yet
4/1/20, 16:21 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Okay thank you
4/1/20, 16:21 - Mazhar: We have an assignment submission on Statistics dated on 26th April
4/1/20, 16:22 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Does anyone has solutions for non graded assignments?
4/1/20, 16:22 - Amit Chopra IPBA: The sheet which jigsaw had to provide
4/1/20, 16:36 - Ankit Jain IPBA: thanks for info
4/1/20, 16:37 - Ankit Jain IPBA: this can be taken offline üòÇüòÅ
4/1/20, 16:44 - +91 99184 37313: Thanks mazhar
4/1/20, 16:44 - Mazhar: Happy to help
4/1/20, 18:04 - Babi IPBA: Guys do not share any attachments here.  Share it on email instead. Mosses session invite has the email addresses. Follow the group posting protocol. üôè
4/1/20, 18:35 - Mazhar: This is a student's group as the name suggests,
What did you have in mind as its purpose  when you created this group?

File sharing on whatsapp is convenient, so is making conversation and getting to know everyone.

We aren't sharing memes,
Just useful docs which don't even use much data
4/1/20, 18:36 - Ankit Jain IPBA: agreed .. knowledge related to course can be shared on watsapp grp it seems more convenient than mails
4/1/20, 18:37 - Mazhar: Thanks, 
Those that don't find file sharing useful can just turn off  "auto download files" in whatsapp settings
4/1/20, 18:39 - Sakshi IPBA: Agreed!!
4/1/20, 18:40 - Siddharth IPBA: Seconded
4/1/20, 18:41 - Prasanna IPBA: Couldn‚Äôt agree more. It would be helpful for everyone.
4/1/20, 18:46 - Babi IPBA: Sorry i do not buy this. There is a better way to write it. We have e-mail to share large content then cluttering mobile storage.
4/1/20, 18:47 - Kajal IPBA: Agreed
4/1/20, 18:48 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: I guess if it‚Äôs something related to the course it should really be fine
4/1/20, 18:49 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: What‚Äôs app sharing is much more convenient and simple I guess
4/1/20, 18:49 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: And we can turn off the auto download option if using an android or iOS users its never an issue
4/1/20, 18:55 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: Agreed
4/1/20, 19:02 - Amit Chopra IPBA: True that
4/1/20, 19:14 - Mazhar: We think that we should have a group where we should not worry about being corrected and disciplined by the admin again and again with petty issues.

We should be able to share files, links relevant to the course.

And even make some conversation about people's/group members careers/work experience etc, and learn more about each other
4/1/20, 19:14 - Mazhar: You can join the new group if you like to
4/1/20, 19:14 - Mazhar: Follow this link to join my WhatsApp group: https://chat.whatsapp.com/KTYHYMIpGTm3azaKxZn05g
4/1/20, 19:15 - Mazhar: How does this look?
Just forward this to the members, if they want to, they can join
4/1/20, 19:16 - +91 99184 37313: Sure
4/1/20, 19:19 - Prasanna IPBA: Guys, let‚Äôs keep things simple with a single students group. Python classes seems complicated enough already. I think this idea seems a viable solution.
4/1/20, 19:21 - Mazhar: I would prefer the same,
But I got msgs agreeing with what just said,
4/1/20, 19:22 - Mazhar: I suggest we can keep short to the point conversations over here
4/1/20, 19:23 - Avinash IPBA: Agree
4/1/20, 19:23 - Mazhar: While file sharing, other talks, like learning more about each other over there
4/1/20, 19:31 - Rajashekhar IPBA: üëçüèºüëÜüèºüëÜüèºüëÜüèº
4/1/20, 19:36 - Babi IPBA: If you think apart, there are better way of collaboration and content   sharing. Make best use of it. Google provided wondering features free of cost for collaboration. How many of you are aware of it ?. Upload n-size files on google drive, enable sharing with everyone and post the link here. Let everyone add files they want to share. All available in one place always for you.
4/1/20, 19:37 - Kajal IPBA left
4/1/20, 19:37 - Rajashekhar IPBA left
4/1/20, 19:39 - Neerav IPBA: Your idea isn‚Äôt unreasonable , just that I don‚Äôt think it was presented the same way with the intention of making it easier and convenient for all . More like one person dictating terms .
4/1/20, 19:40 - Neerav IPBA: I‚Äôm sure the idea will be entertained .
4/1/20, 19:41 - +91 81308 61314 left
4/1/20, 19:41 - Mazhar: I'm paraphrasing what someone said  "felt like sitting in a school with a class monitor"
4/1/20, 19:42 - Neerav IPBA: It‚Äôs alright , let‚Äôs put it to rest .
4/1/20, 19:42 - Sandy IPBA: Friends a request let's not exit the group and form an other group.. it might just lead to too many groups ..
4/1/20, 19:42 - Neerav IPBA: We all know everyone has clear intentions as far as helping each other goes
4/1/20, 19:42 - Neerav IPBA: üòÑ
4/1/20, 19:42 - Sandy IPBA: let's forget it and enjoy the learning

4/1/20, 19:53 - Babi IPBA: If you think, this is best way to share files year. Go ahead üëç
4/1/20, 19:54 - Rahul IPBA: Who are you?? What is your role.
4/1/20, 19:55 - Prab IPBA left
4/1/20, 19:55 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: Its not about sharing files ..u have to understand that its a student's group where things can't be dictated
4/1/20, 19:56 - Sandy IPBA: Rahul a request , let's drop it and use the group for knowledge sharing in every possible way..
4/1/20, 19:56 - Rahul IPBA: @919822213707  I will strongly recommend, you should leave this group.
4/1/20, 19:56 - Sandy IPBA: Rahul we don't need such strong messages yaar.. just forget it
4/1/20, 19:57 - Rahul IPBA: I get to know, he is not from Jigsaw or IIM.
4/1/20, 19:57 - Rahul IPBA: Then what is his role.
4/1/20, 19:57 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: knowledge sharing should be unconstrained ..it cannot follow protocols
4/1/20, 19:57 - Sandy IPBA: he is also one of us who took the initiative to create this group and got all of us join this group
4/1/20, 19:58 - Siddharth IPBA: So....
Are we joining another group?
4/1/20, 19:58 - Sandy IPBA: agree until it's around the learning it should
4/1/20, 19:58 - Sandy IPBA: so a request if we could leave this topic.
4/1/20, 19:58 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: Your wish..majority have joined already
4/1/20, 20:00 - Debraj Saha IPBA: A student like us
4/1/20, 20:02 - Rahul IPBA: My point is: if he not from Jigsaw or IIM, then why he is dictating the rules. He should be aware to whom he is talking. I assume he is fresher. There are more tha 20+ years of experience people in this group. Most of people are happy, if Babi leaves the group. I don't mind for anything. I don't have any problem. Lets finish this now. Feel free to share and discuss anything. And lets share the knowledge. Thanks.
4/1/20, 20:04 - Mazhar: Calm down Rahul,
How about Babi just stop playing teacher/admin and just let everyone do what they want, share files, talk etc
4/1/20, 20:04 - Rahul IPBA: Thanks Sandeep.
4/1/20, 20:05 - Rahul IPBA: üëçüèªüëçüèª
4/1/20, 20:07 - Sandy IPBA: let's all just drop it here and not to have any bitter feelings for anyone .. we have not even met in person as yet üòÄüòÄ.. So let's make the best of the group.
4/1/20, 20:10 - Susandeep IPBA: üëç
4/1/20, 22:50 - Ritu Batra IPBA: What is the deadline for completing the assignment
4/1/20, 22:51 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: For non- graded there is no limit i guess... but for graded Moses will tell...
4/2/20, 17:59 - Poonam IPBA: Hi Everyone,

4/7/20, 07:20 - Neerav IPBA: #** How many people have the word Chief in their job title? 
-sum(sal[sal['JobTitle']=='Chief']).count()
4/7/20, 07:21 - Neerav IPBA: this doesn't seem to give me the required o/p . can someone suggest a work around .
4/7/20, 07:22 - Neerav IPBA: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
4/7/20, 07:31 - Srikanth IPBA: If this is from the udemy course, I can send you my solution.
4/7/20, 07:32 - Neerav IPBA: is it similar to what they have done in their solutions?
4/7/20, 07:33 - Srikanth IPBA: I don remember. Let me send them to you
4/7/20, 07:35 - Neerav IPBA: okay
4/7/20, 07:42 - Srikanth IPBA: sum(sal['JobTitle'].apply(lambda x: chief_string(x)))

'''
Alternative solutions

jobs = sal["JobTitle"].tolist()
chiefs = list(filter(lambda x: 'CHIEF' in x.upper(), jobs))

(OR)

sal[sal['JobTitle'].str.contains("Chief",case=False)]['Id'].count()
'''
4/7/20, 07:43 - Srikanth IPBA: Correct answer is 627
4/7/20, 07:45 - Neerav IPBA: i was avoiding lambda for the moment but thanks
4/7/20, 07:46 - Neerav IPBA: also where did yo confirm the answer , cuz the said answer is different in the solutions
4/7/20, 07:46 - Neerav IPBA: you*
4/7/20, 07:53 - Srikanth IPBA: He did mention in the video that his solution was not entirely correct. I searched for the correct answer under q&a tab.
4/7/20, 08:15 - Neerav IPBA: oh i didnt go through the video, went through the python notebooks itself . thanks for clearing it out .
4/7/20, 14:48 - Suyash Tibrawala IPBA: Anyone tried the atm problem from the inferential stats lecture slide?
4/7/20, 14:48 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: Is there any grade assignment?
4/7/20, 14:49 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Yes I did
4/7/20, 14:51 - Suyash Tibrawala IPBA: Can you show me your solution
4/7/20, 15:30 - Adarsh Baluapuri: Do we have any graded assignments yet ?
4/7/20, 15:48 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Nope
4/7/20, 23:42 - Sanchit IPBA: Yeah. I did, using Poisson distribution since this problem involves Time period. My answer was 92 withdrawals per day bcz for this no. the probability was under 10
4/7/20, 23:44 - Sanchit IPBA: Avg. trxn amount was $40 so for 92 trxn per day it should be $3680 and since they asked for the stock of 4 days it should be 3680 * 4 = 14,720$
4/7/20, 23:51 - Sanchit IPBA: {1-(92,80, TRUE)} = This will give the probability greater than 92 trxns per day
4/8/20, 08:26 - Aj IPBA: Could someone please give me the link for this weekend class recordings. Thanks.
4/10/20, 14:26 - Shriya IPBA: Can anybody tell where I can find recording for 4 and 5 April class on probability and statistics,I cannot find it on JLC portal
4/10/20, 14:37 - Shriya IPBA: I found
4/10/20, 14:44 - Sandy IPBA: it isn't uploaded it seems..
4/10/20, 15:21 - Sakshi IPBA: I can see under recording but it's not working
4/10/20, 15:21 - Sakshi IPBA: Nothing is getting played
4/10/20, 15:29 - Gaurav Pramod IPBA: <Media omitted>
4/10/20, 15:29 - Gaurav Pramod IPBA: Its working 5 apr class
4/10/20, 17:16 - Boojashree IPBA: Why is it 1-()?
4/10/20, 19:15 - Sakshi IPBA: Which of the lecture slides has the problem...I am unable to locate
4/10/20, 20:11 - Sourabh Patil IPBA: Answer is in video section 
Please check
4/10/20, 20:16 - Sakshi IPBA: Yes got it... thanks
4/10/20, 21:20 - Neerav IPBA: Did we get the learning plan for this weekend ?
4/10/20, 21:20 - Neerav IPBA: What all topics do we have to go through ?
4/10/20, 21:48 - Swarnapava Ray IPBA: Guys from where I will get previous lectures ppt?
4/10/20, 22:02 - Sanchit IPBA: Because if you do not minus the prob. of 92 from 1 then with the option TRUE in the formula it means you are calculating CDF (that area graph where probability is cont. , no discrete values and max prob. Value can be 1 where data points is on x axis and prob. on y axis) which means it will give the area from 0 to 92, means it will give the probability of trxns from 0 to 92 but in this problem we require to calculate the prob. more than 80 trxns , in this particular formula we want probability of more than 92 trxns, not 0 to 92 trxns. So we have to calculate the area after the 92 in cdf so for that are we will minus this area from 1.
4/10/20, 22:03 - Sanchit IPBA: Pls correct me if I have missed something or interpreted wrongly as I am also new to all this prob. concepts

4/11/20, 00:12 - Ritu Batra IPBA: When will the graded assignments begin
4/11/20, 09:54 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: Morning guys, we using zoom or hangout?
4/11/20, 09:55 - Mazhar: Zoom
4/11/20, 09:55 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: zoom
4/11/20, 09:55 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Xoom
4/11/20, 09:55 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Zoom
4/11/20, 09:55 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: Thanks Ritu, I owe u. 1 samosa
4/11/20, 09:55 - Mazhar: Got the link on the IIM group by Moses right now
4/11/20, 10:21 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: Unable to connect
4/11/20, 10:22 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Msg it to Moses
4/11/20, 12:59 - Srikanth IPBA: Can anyone please explain why z(alpha/2) is multipled by sigma/root(n) to get the final interval?
4/11/20, 13:01 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Even I didn‚Äôt get this
4/11/20, 13:15 - Prasanna IPBA: Sigma is the standard deviation of population. We need SD of sample which is sigma/root(n) where n is sample size.
4/11/20, 13:19 - Srikanth IPBA: I think it directly follows from the equation z = (x bar - mu pop)/sigma pop (rearrange terms to calculate mu pop)
4/11/20, 13:22 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Okay
4/11/20, 13:26 - Sundar Nagarajan IPBA: To calculate the interval we need the Margin of error..
4/11/20, 13:26 - Sundar Nagarajan IPBA: Added to the sample mean
4/11/20, 13:27 - Sundar Nagarajan IPBA: It is the formula as such
4/11/20, 13:34 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: Yes 
U r right 
Alpha/2 = because of symmetry of curve 
Sigma/root(n) because we need sample Std deviation

4/18/20, 10:39 - Siddhant Shrivastava IPBA: I also sent this to moses
4/18/20, 10:39 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: Lol it's been 40 mins...
4/18/20, 10:40 - Swarnapava Ray IPBA: Missing prof Harshal
4/18/20, 10:40 - Avinash IPBA: Explanation in Hindi wouldn't help at the speed prof. is rushing..
4/18/20, 10:40 - Avinash IPBA: Me 2
4/18/20, 10:41 - Swarnapava Ray IPBA: Harshal's class was interesting
4/18/20, 10:41 - Abhinav IPBA: Let's write on the official group in which he messaged just now
4/18/20, 10:41 - Surupa IPBA: Yeah
4/18/20, 10:41 - Akansha Jain IPBA: Guys please don‚Äôt make comments on zoom
4/18/20, 10:41 - Sandy IPBA: üòÄüòÄüòÄ
4/18/20, 10:42 - Neerav IPBA: True , this‚Äôs not helping .
4/18/20, 10:42 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: Guys pls raise this issue, most of us are not from a statistics background, we can't keep up with this pace... Otherwise the whole exercise will be pointless
4/18/20, 10:42 - Sandy IPBA: Real time feedback üòÄüòÄ
4/18/20, 10:42 - Poonam IPBA: Exactly
4/18/20, 10:43 - Manasi IPBA: Can we please stop comparing the professor with proff Harshal over the zoom platform .
4/18/20, 10:43 - Neerav IPBA: More like real time disrespect .
4/18/20, 10:43 - Prashik Patil IPBA: Yes abdul.
Might most of us learn statistics before 8-10 years back. üòÇü§£
4/18/20, 10:44 - Somebody Awesome IPBA: Let's politely write to the official mailbox, that it would be helpful if Prof. Harshal completes what he started..He cant leave us like this to drownüòúüòÑ
4/18/20, 10:44 - Manasi IPBA: Exactly. Let's not do this. Please try to understand that all of us are working from home and internet issue is not something that the proff can resolve.
4/18/20, 10:44 - Siddharth IPBA: Yeah man 
Let‚Äôs keep it between us. And raise the issue formally to moses
4/18/20, 10:45 - Poonam IPBA: Please avoid texting regarding the lecture on zoom chat window
4/18/20, 10:45 - Babi IPBA: Agree.. this is not right approach. Pls share feedback with Mr. Moses
4/18/20, 10:45 - Avinash IPBA: Agree
4/18/20, 10:45 - Shankar IPBA: Please provide feedback to Moses and carry it forward from there... Posting comments zoom is disrespectful to the prof and it's unprofessional of us
4/18/20, 10:46 - Poonam IPBA: Prof harshal would make even a non statistician excel on the subject. We are totally spoilt
4/18/20, 10:46 - Babi IPBA: We cannot expect all to be in line with Prof Harshal.
4/18/20, 10:47 - Somebody Awesome IPBA: True and we expect the best..now that webknow what is bestüòÑ
4/18/20, 10:47 - Poonam IPBA: True !

4/18/20, 10:50 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: Guys we should raise issues if we have them politely... Otherwise Moses will think we r happy with the pace and quality of the session
4/18/20, 10:57 - Manasi IPBA: Politely is the most important term here.
4/18/20, 10:58 - Babi IPBA: Let us not target Mr. Prof. On the race. I feel like it is  more of disrespect to him. Rather share the concerns and feedback with Moses and let Jigsaw sort that problems.
4/18/20, 10:59 - Babi IPBA: On the face
4/18/20, 11:09 - Babi IPBA: And as I understand Prof. Is one of the senior faculty and definitely he needs a bit of respect to where is stands now in his career life.

4/19/20, 10:57 - Siddharth IPBA: For the population
4/19/20, 10:58 - Siddharth IPBA: As far as i understand the datapoints we have are samples and this tells us that even if you consider the entire population it will follow the same behaviour
4/19/20, 10:58 - Shankar IPBA: The means you see are for samples
4/19/20, 10:58 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: Excellent ty

4/21/20, 10:47 - Babi IPBA: <Media omitted>
4/21/20, 10:47 - Babi IPBA: In line to this please solve the below.
4/21/20, 10:47 - Babi IPBA: Matt reads at an average (mean) rate of 20.6 pages per hour, with a standard
deviation of 3.2. What percent of the time will he read between 15 and 26.2
pages per hour?
4/21/20, 10:57 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: Ty Babi...
4/21/20, 10:59 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: 1.75 z score or 96% of the time
4/21/20, 11:00 - Debraj Saha IPBA: 78% babi
4/21/20, 11:01 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: My baf
4/21/20, 11:01 - Neerav IPBA: According to the picture , shouldn‚Äôt it be 68%  if we are amounting to 2std
4/21/20, 11:01 - Babi IPBA: I have visually put the theorem for you. Please read the question correctly and answer
4/21/20, 11:02 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: It's 1.75 SD so less than 2
4/21/20, 11:02 - Debraj Saha IPBA: Sorry, it's 59.5%
4/21/20, 11:03 - Debraj Saha IPBA: As per chebyshev
4/21/20, 11:03 - Babi IPBA: Incorrect
4/21/20, 11:03 - Babi IPBA: Incorrect
4/21/20, 11:04 - Debraj Saha IPBA: When you have the answer then try back calculating simple
4/21/20, 11:04 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: Haha
4/21/20, 11:05 - Babi IPBA: Z-score is correct
4/21/20, 11:09 - Mazhar: Chebyshev is valid for all disstributions, whatever be their shape, and pay attention to its statement, the words include minimum 


The 68-95-99.7 is only valid for normal distributions,

The 68-95-99.7 also satisfies chebyshev
4/21/20, 11:10 - Babi IPBA: Please read the question and focus on what is asked for
4/21/20, 11:11 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: We r fucked boys üò∂
4/21/20, 11:11 - Neerav IPBA: It should be just less than 68% but I ain‚Äôt sure about my explanation so ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
4/21/20, 11:12 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: Agreed
4/21/20, 11:12 - Babi IPBA: No hard words please.
4/21/20, 11:12 - Mazhar: I'd rather juat go back to sleep
4/21/20, 11:12 - Babi IPBA: You are close
4/21/20, 11:12 - Mazhar: Please follow the protocols
4/21/20, 11:13 - Neerav IPBA: It‚Äôs stats , can‚Äôt really assume stuff , need to be precise about it . Do let us know for the viable solution .
4/21/20, 11:14 - Babi IPBA: The correct answer is 67.3 percent. However everyone should try to calculate it. I will provide explanation later
4/21/20, 11:20 - Neerav IPBA: <Media omitted>
4/21/20, 11:21 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: I trying to find a table
4/21/20, 11:22 - Babi IPBA: You got it Neerav üëç well done
4/21/20, 11:25 - Neerav IPBA: From the given mean of 20.6 with the SD -3.2  our calculated z score 1.75 is approx 2stds (1.75 *2 =3.5) away from the given SD. From the given visual 2SD is 68% and hence our percent will be slightly less than that . Please tell me if this makes sense .
4/21/20, 11:29 - Babi IPBA: Yes. You got it.
4/21/20, 11:29 - Babi IPBA: Here is the explanation and answer
4/21/20, 11:29 - Babi IPBA: 15 pages per hour corresponds to a z-score of 15‚àí20.6 /3.2 = ‚àí1.75, and
26.2 pages per hour corresponds to a z-score of 26.2‚àí20.6/3.2 = 1.75.

Chebyshev‚Äôs Theorem says that 1 ‚àí 1/(1.752^2) = 0.673 of the values will be within 1.75 standard deviations, so 68 - 0.672 =  67.3% of the time, Matt‚Äôs reading speed will be between 15 and 26.2 pages per hour.
4/21/20, 11:29 - Neerav IPBA: Cool , now I can peacefully do so .
4/21/20, 19:41 - Babi IPBA: Question-2 of the day. Note this is a framed questions. Please only respond with your answer after your work out.
4/21/20, 19:42 - Babi IPBA: A recent startup "XYZ Analytics" wanted to publish the salary information into the leading IT magazine to gain publicity. The following is the salary samples:

30K 45K 10K 55K 65K, 60K 100K, 50K, 150K, 61K, 57K

Which measure of central tendency will the startup use to show that their employees are fairly paid to the satisfaction ?
4/21/20, 19:43 - Siddharth IPBA: Is this from the non graded assignment?
4/21/20, 19:43 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: Yes
4/21/20, 19:44 - Siddharth IPBA: Seemed familiar
4/21/20, 19:44 - Babi IPBA: No. This is my framed question
4/21/20, 20:37 - Bharat IPBA: Guys we have to do only non graded assignments, right?
4/21/20, 20:42 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: I think for practice
4/21/20, 21:09 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: Is the answer Mean/average
4/21/20, 23:34 - Sanchit IPBA: Babi Is the ans for this que is Median ?
4/21/20, 23:35 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: I think it shouldn't me median cause the AVG comes out higher than the median
4/21/20, 23:36 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: And u want the highest possible number as the answer
4/22/20, 00:08 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: I guess we only have to do the graded assignments
4/22/20, 00:14 - Sanchit IPBA: Hi Abdul. I am thinking of Median because this sample has possible outliers if I am Interpreting it correctly, I.e. 30k, 100k, 150k and in case of outlier I read somewhere that we should median as measure
4/22/20, 00:14 - Sanchit IPBA: No sure about this though üòä
4/22/20, 00:20 - Neerav IPBA: I think if the question had been not paid to satisfaction then mean would be required cuz then we would compare from the avg to see if they reach that mark , for satisfaction , mean can‚Äôt really tell us if they are actually satisfied , a point to reference should be median .
4/22/20, 00:21 - Neerav IPBA: Actually paid to satisfy .
4/22/20, 00:43 - Siddharth IPBA: But when it comes to an avg companies want to display a better number 
So I think we can use Average.
4/22/20, 07:57 - Babi IPBA: If you want to find how employees are badly paid given the sample of salary, you should look at the outliers i.e Median. In this case the outliers are 10k and 150k so there is a more variance. However, the question is talking about a fair pay and Mean Salary what the company will use to position itself in the market. This is what the measures of central tendency states.

4/23/20, 00:13 - Susandeep IPBA: ok
4/23/20, 14:10 - Prashik Patil IPBA: Is any one tell me how to calculate simple random sampling question answer
4/23/20, 14:11 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: basic question, as per Chebyshev does 1 SD cover 68% of data points or 75%... and which will we use moving forward...
4/23/20, 14:25 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: 68%
4/23/20, 14:25 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: 2 nd std Dev 95%
4/23/20, 14:34 - Manasi IPBA: Same üò≠
4/23/20, 14:35 - Ankit Singh IPBA: Same here üò∂
4/23/20, 14:35 - Babi IPBA: <Media omitted>
4/23/20, 14:36 - Babi IPBA: Do not confuse. As per chebyshev 2sd is 68 percent and not one sd.
4/23/20, 14:36 - Babi IPBA: And 3sd is 89 percent
4/23/20, 14:38 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: <Media omitted>
4/23/20, 14:38 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: as per wiki, 68-95-99.7 is used in the three-sigma rule....
4/23/20, 14:39 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: as per Chebyshev's thorem isnt it 75% between 2 SD
4/23/20, 14:41 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: Babi what abt slide
4/23/20, 14:41 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: It‚Äôs showing 75 % by 2 std dev
4/23/20, 14:41 - Debraj Saha IPBA: Follow that Saha da
4/23/20, 14:42 - Manasi IPBA: Chebyshev is this only. 68-95 is for normal distribution if I am not wrong üòê
4/23/20, 14:43 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: 68 1 std Dev
4/23/20, 14:43 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: 75 2nd std Dev
4/23/20, 14:45 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: 89 3rd std dev
4/23/20, 14:45 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: 95 4 th std Dev
4/23/20, 14:45 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: Right?
4/23/20, 14:49 - Siddharth IPBA: No 
+-2std dev contain approximately 95% of the data
4/23/20, 14:50 - Siddharth IPBA: Yeah 
Even i think so..
4/23/20, 14:50 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: Chebyshev and 3sigma rule has different ranges
4/23/20, 14:52 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: <Media omitted>
4/23/20, 14:54 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: Ok
4/23/20, 14:55 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: Then shavi is following different rule Nd sigma rule is different
4/23/20, 18:56 - Preeti IPBA: I think as per  chebyshev‚Äôs theorem 
Z=2, 75% data lies 
Z= 3, 89% data lies
Z= 4, 94% data lies
And it is good for any data set used to state minimum or at-least probability 

Where as Empirical rule which follows normal distribution 
Z=1, 68% data lies
Z= 2, 95% data lies
Z=3, 99.7% data lies almost all data values
4/23/20, 19:14 - Ritu Batra IPBA: The difference lies in the kind of distribution. In case of normal distribution it is 68-95-99
For all other distributions it is at least 75-89-93
4/23/20, 19:15 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Note 68 is for 1SD and 75 for 2SD
4/23/20, 19:28 - Poonam IPBA: Hi Everyone,

4/24/20, 08:46 - Srikanth IPBA: Very accurate explanation. Thanks
4/24/20, 09:11 - Srikanth IPBA: Can someone please answer this question? In the hypothesis testing, if number of ovservations in a sample is greater than 30 and SD is unknown, what statistic should we use? z or t?
4/24/20, 09:37 - Amit Chopra IPBA: We can use z test if you are saying that the SD of the population is unknown
4/24/20, 10:06 - Srikanth IPBA: I came across one sample where they used t test for unknown SD even when the number of observations is greater than 30. So I got confused
4/24/20, 10:08 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Can you please share the question ?
4/24/20, 10:36 - Manasi IPBA: <Media omitted>
4/24/20, 10:40 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: Mean=(number of cars √ó number per hrs)/(sum of number per hrs)
4/24/20, 10:56 - Manasi IPBA: I tried doing it the same way. I am getting answer 1.8 . But the correct answer is 2.
4/24/20, 11:11 - Boojashree IPBA: Since no of cars cannot be 1.8, we take the aprrox value as 2
4/24/20, 11:11 - Manasi IPBA: Okay
4/24/20, 11:11 - Manasi IPBA: Yeah ! üòÇ Right !
4/24/20, 11:12 - Manasi IPBA: Thank you !

4/24/20, 20:03 - Amit Chopra IPBA: P test
4/24/20, 20:04 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Test of proportion
4/24/20, 20:09 - Suyash Tibrawala IPBA: Can you post your solution?
4/24/20, 20:29 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: Probability of success =3560/8000 =0.445
Final Step:
As the survey follows a binomial distribution.
1-Binom.dist(215,410,0.445,true)
4/24/20, 21:01 - Suyash Tibrawala IPBA: How do we know the prob of success of 0.445 is the company's benchmark because the question doesn't state that? It just says from past data this is what the company knows
4/24/20, 21:02 - Suyash Tibrawala IPBA: It's kind of unclear
4/24/20, 23:25 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: I simply used the formula of 
Probability of ppl asking for a new flavor so that I can use it as probability of success when  we use it for sample of 410 n I felt the sample was following a binomial distribution so using past data I calculated the probability
4/24/20, 23:48 - Sanchit IPBA: Hi Avinash. Can you please post your ans. I want to check my ans. The way I solved it is like, if there is total no. of 600 coupons then 500 would be play again and 75 would be free donuts and 12.5 each for car and bike so I think it should be like:
Donuts = 75/600 = 0.125
Car = 12.5/600 = 0.020
Bike = 12.5/600 = 0.020
4/24/20, 23:49 - Suyash Tibrawala IPBA: Okay ty
4/25/20, 00:05 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Shouldn‚Äôt final ans be = prob of donut X prob of TV X prob of not winning
4/25/20, 00:59 - Sanchit IPBA: I think you are right Ritu. Their respective probabilities should b multiplied. I think I am not concentrating enough on the problem statement and hence calculated the prob. for each of it
4/25/20, 00:59 - Sanchit IPBA: Thanks for pointing it out Ritu
4/25/20, 09:05 - Avinash IPBA: Thanks Rotu, I also missed this.. It's almost similar to without replacement of cards..üëç

4/25/20, 12:06 - Swayam IPBA: 30 points
4/25/20, 12:06 - Swayam IPBA: It is written here
4/25/20, 12:06 - Swayam IPBA: Some questions would be for 2 points or more I guess
4/25/20, 12:06 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: ok
4/25/20, 13:02 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Should I also go through jigsaw videos?
4/25/20, 13:03 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Because most of the questions people are posting are not related to that prof. Covered
4/25/20, 13:44 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: I think it's better if you go through them, some of them r just read outs of slides from class... It's time consuming, but I am halfway done...
4/25/20, 13:55 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: I‚Äôm playing them at 2x
4/25/20, 13:55 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: There are a lot of them xD
4/25/20, 13:55 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: And I wasn‚Äôt aware until now that we have Jigsaw‚Äôs videos as well
4/25/20, 13:56 - Srikanth IPBA: 2x will be crazy. Because I think the instructor normally goes at 2x lol
4/25/20, 13:56 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: It kind is fast but I‚Äôm used to studying like this xD
4/25/20, 13:56 - Srikanth IPBA: You can go through them, but more than 80% stuff is repetitive
4/25/20, 13:57 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: All those studying one night before the exams in engg. Surely helps xD
4/25/20, 13:57 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Ah okay thank you
4/25/20, 13:57 - Neerav IPBA: If you go through these vids as a prerequisite then the actual class will be very boring
4/25/20, 13:57 - Neerav IPBA: I realized this the first time I did it
4/25/20, 13:58 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: Lol
4/25/20, 13:58 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: yes i can feel that most of these we have covered in class
4/25/20, 13:58 - Neerav IPBA: Honestly I like the explanation better
4/25/20, 13:58 - Neerav IPBA: Quite straight forward
4/25/20, 14:02 - Abhinav IPBA: Guys tomorrow we have only the MCQ assessment, not the case study assessment right?
4/25/20, 14:03 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: I guess
4/25/20, 14:03 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Yes not taking up way too much time on things which are not needed
4/25/20, 14:03 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: ya no classes tomorrow
4/25/20, 14:04 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Today‚Äôs class haven‚Äôt started either right?

4/25/20, 16:47 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: Non parametric tests will be part of tomorrow's assessment?
4/25/20, 16:51 - Romita IPBA: Alpha will always .5 ?
4/25/20, 16:51 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: I hope it doesnt...
4/25/20, 16:51 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: 0.05
4/25/20, 16:52 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: It‚Äôs 5 percent
4/25/20, 16:52 - Romita IPBA: For one way or two way always .05
4/25/20, 16:52 - Romita IPBA: ?
4/25/20, 16:52 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: One tailed test 0.025
4/25/20, 16:52 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Ie 2.5%
4/25/20, 16:52 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: For two tailed 5% or 0.05
4/25/20, 16:52 - Romita IPBA: But ANOVA which we did it was .05
4/25/20, 16:53 - Amit Chopra IPBA: But today the prof said that for one tailed it is .05
4/25/20, 16:53 - Romita IPBA: Yes
4/25/20, 16:53 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: For Anova yes it‚Äôs always 0.05
4/25/20, 16:56 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: It is because ANOVA uses F distribution which is always one tailed
4/25/20, 16:58 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: <Media omitted>
4/25/20, 17:01 - Babi IPBA: One tail is 0.05 and two tail is 0.05/2 = 0.025
4/25/20, 17:04 - Prashik Patil IPBA: What % can assume for
Reject H0
And
H1
4/25/20, 17:05 - Prashik Patil IPBA: Can anyone tell Pls
4/25/20, 17:06 - Babi IPBA: The industry standard is 0.05 that mean less than this value, reject null
4/25/20, 17:33 - Lakshminarayan IPBA: 5% or 0.05
4/25/20, 17:35 - Babi IPBA: In statistics you denote 5% as 0.05 and use for calculation.

4/25/20, 23:20 - Boojashree IPBA: Use combin formula in excel
4/25/20, 23:20 - Girish Kumar: Made calculation error my bad

4/25/20, 23:25 - Susandeep IPBA: thx
4/25/20, 23:25 - Mazhar: If I have a p-value for which I want to calculate corresponding z score, how would I do it in excel.?
4/25/20, 23:26 - Mazhar: I want to figure the z-score for p-value = 0.95
4/25/20, 23:26 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Norms.S. dist
4/25/20, 23:27 - Mazhar: Thanks
4/25/20, 23:37 - Srikanth IPBA: To add, I remember jitendra mentioning 21 questions from a lot of 100. So most will get different sets and order of questions.
4/25/20, 23:39 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: If order shuffles no probs if problem changes it is problem
4/25/20, 23:40 - Mazhar: Very likely,
Its IIM, so they would take precautions to prevent cheating
4/25/20, 23:41 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Yeah that‚Äôs true

4/25/20, 23:44 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: 1-Poisson(20,40,true)
4/25/20, 23:44 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: Explain unlike professor
4/25/20, 23:45 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: Poisson distribution because question has time frame attached
4/25/20, 23:47 - Uttam Agrawal IPBA: Thanks..it workedüëç
4/25/20, 23:47 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: <Media omitted>
4/25/20, 23:48 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: We use true as cumulative as we r interested in knowing cases more than 20 call
4/25/20, 23:49 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: N use 1-poisson because we want to probability of call more than 20
4/25/20, 23:49 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: Is 0.035 correct
4/25/20, 23:50 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: Use 1-poisson(20,30,true) in excel
4/25/20, 23:50 - Swayam IPBA: Achaa 5 ka kd
4/25/20, 23:50 - Uttam Agrawal IPBA: 0.965 is correct
4/25/20, 23:50 - Swayam IPBA: My bad
4/25/20, 23:50 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: That's the probability for calls less than equal to 20
4/25/20, 23:51 - Romita IPBA: Guys don't mind but it's common in old batches also to share the answeres while graded assignment.
4/25/20, 23:52 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: Thanks

4/25/20, 23:54 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: Don‚Äôt be mad becz I am learning
4/25/20, 23:54 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: See
4/25/20, 23:54 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: Not answer bro bout how to do in steps
4/25/20, 23:54 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: But*
4/25/20, 23:55 - Susandeep IPBA: carry on .. its helpful
4/25/20, 23:55 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: The mean would remain the sample and for the population
4/25/20, 23:55 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: It‚Äôs just how things work
4/25/20, 23:55 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: When you draw the curve
4/25/20, 23:55 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: You can have it  visually pictured
4/25/20, 23:56 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Or it changes by such a small margins that we can ignore it
4/25/20, 23:56 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: So the mean of population = mean of sample
4/25/20, 23:56 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: What changes is standard deviation
4/25/20, 23:56 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: So to find the new std deviation we use the formula
4/25/20, 23:57 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Mean/square root of(N)
4/25/20, 23:57 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: N is the sample size ie 49 I guess
4/25/20, 23:59 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Put in the values and you will have the answer
4/26/20, 00:00 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: I understand a bit
4/26/20, 00:00 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: Can I have a calculator view
4/26/20, 00:02 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: Like written answer
4/26/20, 00:02 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: It was a written answer okay wait
4/26/20, 00:03 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Answer would be mean = 50 because of this
4/26/20, 00:03 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: 1.5 because 10.5/sqrt(49)
Y sqrt of 49
Because when the sample >=30 the sample mean follows CLT(central limit theorem)
Which mathematically states that the sample mean = population mean but sample Std dev= popn std dev/sqrt(sample size)
4/26/20, 00:03 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: STD Dev = 10.5/sqrt(49)
4/26/20, 00:04 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: Now I am awsome thanks

4/26/20, 00:50 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: Hai teach me quest 6,7
4/26/20, 00:51 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: So idk how they did it in the formula
4/26/20, 00:51 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: But I took the easy approach
4/26/20, 00:51 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: We know that mean is 55
4/26/20, 00:51 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: We don‚Äôt have N
4/26/20, 00:51 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: So it must be a z test
4/26/20, 00:52 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: So I check value of z at 2.46
4/26/20, 00:52 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: I check p value at z=2.46
4/26/20, 00:52 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Simply from the table
4/26/20, 00:53 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: Ok
4/26/20, 00:54 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: This one
4/26/20, 00:54 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: And Idk how to do q7
4/26/20, 00:54 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: As I said
4/26/20, 00:54 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: I didn‚Äôt use the formula
4/26/20, 00:54 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: So I‚Äôm not sure
4/26/20, 00:54 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: It is 5th q
4/26/20, 00:55 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Naah bro it‚Äôs 6th

4/26/20, 00:58 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: For
4/26/20, 00:58 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Going by mathematical stats
4/26/20, 00:58 - Avinash IPBA: This one
4/26/20, 00:59 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Her winning in 3rd game
4/26/20, 00:59 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: So first two game she lost
4/26/20, 00:59 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Prob of her losing is 1-0.55
4/26/20, 00:59 - Akansha Jain IPBA: P(Anne loosing)=1-0.55

That‚Äôs why

0.45*0.45*0.55
4/26/20, 00:59 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Which is 0.45
4/26/20, 00:59 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: So 0.45*0.45*0.55
4/26/20, 01:02 - Avinash IPBA: Negbinom.dist(2,1,0.55,false)

4/28/20, 17:56 - Manasi IPBA: It is P(not being yellow given it is not 4 )
4/28/20, 17:56 - Manasi IPBA: So that is P(not being yellow and not being 4) divided by P(not being 4)
4/28/20, 17:57 - Manasi IPBA: There will be only 4 card with the number 4 ... So that is 36 cards
4/28/20, 18:13 - Sanchit IPBA: I was thinking like since there will be no yellow so we will not be considering any yellow card ao I deducted 10 cards from total of 40
4/28/20, 18:24 - Prasanna IPBA: First we are picking a yellow card of say number 4 and Since we are picking cards without replacement, the probability of picking card not 4 is (39-3)/(40-1). Now we have 36 cards which are not 4.
4/28/20, 18:24 - Prasanna IPBA: In those 36 cards , we have 9 yellow cards. Since we already picked a yellow card, chances of picking the second card which isn‚Äôt yellow is (36-9)/36
4/28/20, 19:17 - Sanchit IPBA: So it becomes 27/36
4/28/20, 19:19 - Sanchit IPBA: Now I got it

5/9/20, 09:47 - Sourabh Patil IPBA: Send your mail id
5/9/20, 09:49 - Sourabh Patil IPBA: <Media omitted>
5/9/20, 10:02 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: saha.international01@gmail.com
5/9/20, 10:04 - Sourabh Patil IPBA: I think this is the file you want?
5/9/20, 10:05 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: Yes
5/9/20, 10:27 - Gaurav Mahajan IPBA: Hi... anyone knows how to deal with a machine on company domain...hence SQL gives out permission denied to database for any query
5/9/20, 10:44 - Sakshi IPBA: Even I am using SQL server...my query executed successfully and I can see the northwind dB too but inside that I can't see any tables
5/9/20, 11:12 - Srikanth IPBA: Right click on database and click refresh
5/9/20, 11:13 - Sakshi IPBA: Did that too but it didn't work...finally I deleted the complete dB and created again...can see tables now
5/9/20, 11:14 - Sourabh Patil IPBA: Someone please explain srs33, srs34
Why select command use course crsnbr instead of just crsnbr in srs33
Why select command use course crsnbr and course cname instead of crsnbr and cname in srs34
5/9/20, 11:21 - Sakshi IPBA: You are selecting data from course and REGN both in srs33 and both table have crsnbr
5/9/20, 11:22 - Sakshi IPBA: So we have to explicitly tell which crsnbr we want
5/9/20, 11:22 - Sakshi IPBA: It's a common attribute for both table
5/9/20, 11:23 - Sakshi IPBA: Same is case of srs34
5/9/20, 11:38 - Romita IPBA: Right click n run as admin.
5/9/20, 11:39 - Gaurav Mahajan IPBA: Ahh..ok..tks..
5/9/20, 11:55 - Sourabh Patil IPBA: üëç
5/9/20, 11:57 - Sourabh Patil IPBA: cname exist only in one table still written as course cname?
5/9/20, 12:06 - Sakshi IPBA: It will work if you ll not use that with cname...for a better understanding we prefer fetching attributes of one table in a similar way
5/9/20, 12:18 - Sourabh Patil IPBA: Thanks üôå
5/9/20, 12:20 - Gaurav Mahajan IPBA: Sorry, not working..
5/9/20, 16:48 - Mazhar: I barely slept at all during class todayüòá.

5/9/20, 16:50 - Chandrika IPBA: true üòÉ
5/9/20, 16:56 - Romita IPBA: True
5/9/20, 17:07 - Srikanth IPBA: Do we have to go through all those 90 .sql files for tomorrows exam?
5/9/20, 17:07 - Srikanth IPBA: I'm surprised no one covered joins
5/9/20, 17:07 - Akash Mannari IPBA: There's so many other things to be covered in SQL actually.
5/9/20, 17:11 - Akash Mannari IPBA: Btw, who so ever using postgres - how did you manage with Northwind?
5/9/20, 17:15 - Srikanth IPBA: I found the postgres version of northwind on the internet. I find Postgres user friendly compared to sql server, but mysql looks better than both. Better to stick to one in the end. I made a mess switching between software in today's class üò∂
5/10/20, 10:44 - Diti IPBA: Did anyone attempt the graded assignment?
5/10/20, 10:48 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Not yet

5/10/20, 14:39 - Bharat IPBA: Thanks guys
5/10/20, 14:42 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: U need to take sum or avg
As u r using > operator
This query will work if Miami has one rec
But will not give right results if u have more than one
5/10/20, 14:42 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: D
5/10/20, 14:44 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: Wait

5/10/20, 14:45 - Gaurav Mahajan IPBA: K..tks
5/10/20, 14:46 - Neerav IPBA: Select unique is used when ?
5/10/20, 14:46 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: It's A
5/10/20, 14:46 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: To remove duplicate recs
5/10/20, 14:47 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: U were tell about the last name order date question, right?
5/10/20, 15:01 - Aj IPBA: Done with the test, it was a relatively simpler in comparison to the last one.
5/10/20, 15:44 - Ritu Batra IPBA: A worked for me
5/10/20, 15:50 - Babi IPBA: Who are the toppers this time
5/10/20, 16:05 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: It will work in sql if Miami has only one record

5/10/20, 19:32 - Poonam IPBA: No
5/10/20, 19:32 - Gaurav Mahajan IPBA: Are there questions from JOIN in the graded assignment?
5/10/20, 19:32 - Gaurav Mahajan IPBA: Tks...
5/10/20, 19:33 - Ritu Batra IPBA: No
5/10/20, 19:33 - Gaurav Mahajan IPBA: Thank you..

5/10/20, 20:26 - Shankar IPBA: This might come in handy
5/10/20, 20:26 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: IF i pass i will lick my monitor DONE
5/10/20, 20:27 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: Thanks a ton bro.. going through it...
5/10/20, 20:38 - Shankar IPBA: What's the answer for this one ??? Is it none ?
5/10/20, 20:39 - Poonam IPBA: A
5/10/20, 20:40 - Shankar IPBA: Oh okay... Thanks
5/10/20, 20:40 - Neerav IPBA: I don‚Äôt get the point of employee ID but it‚Äôs A
5/10/20, 20:41 - Shankar IPBA: Same... I lost that question
5/10/20, 20:41 - Neerav IPBA: Plus the dot thing is irritating , I haven‚Äôt been looking at codes that way ü§®
5/10/20, 20:42 - Shankar IPBA: Yea same confused me as well
5/10/20, 20:49 - Poonam IPBA: Is that answer wrong ?
5/10/20, 20:49 - Neerav IPBA: Nope it‚Äôs A as per logic .
5/10/20, 20:49 - Shankar IPBA: No... I meant i had the wrong answer
5/10/20, 20:49 - Poonam IPBA: Ok
5/10/20, 20:50 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: Employee Id is used to join both the tables using the primary key foreign key relationship to fetch recs
5/10/20, 20:50 - Neerav IPBA: But last name by itself is uniquely identified
5/10/20, 20:51 - Neerav IPBA: Like you‚Äôre calling the actual value of the key
5/10/20, 20:51 - Neerav IPBA: So the key itself isn‚Äôt required ?
5/10/20, 20:55 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: No neerav 
U r fetching the name from employees table but order date from orders so u need a connector(common column) to connect both tables
5/10/20, 20:56 - Neerav IPBA: Clearly missing the point that employee is being picked from employee table üò∂
5/10/20, 20:56 - Neerav IPBA: üôè
5/10/20, 21:08 - Srikanth IPBA: Well, lots of concepts have been left out.

5/10/20, 21:30 - Sandy IPBA: last week was not at worth the time spent

5/10/20, 21:32 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: B

5/12/20, 23:33 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: <Media omitted>
5/12/20, 23:41 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: That's mysql 
This is SQL server 
Lil change in syntax
Join in SQL server is called as Natural Join in Mysql
5/12/20, 23:44 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: Yeh
5/12/20, 23:44 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: Natural join works in MySQL

5/15/20, 16:20 - Swayam IPBA: You need to download R seperately
5/15/20, 16:20 - Swayam IPBA: Then it will work
5/15/20, 16:20 - Siddharth IPBA: Its just like sql and sql server we downlaoded
5/15/20, 16:21 - Siddharth IPBA: R studio is the UI for R

5/17/20, 15:14 - Mazhar: https://youtu.be/_V8eKsto3Ug

Don't put in way too much effort into R though, just get familiar.
Python is much more useful these days
5/17/20, 15:15 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Yah!!! True!
5/17/20, 15:15 - Neerav IPBA: I need prac with python , I do it once I feel confident but don‚Äôt think that lasts for long

5/27/20, 23:52 - Sanchit IPBA: Hello Everyone. I am trying to plot a viz. Where I need to show data from 3 groups. For ex, top 10 countries where temp changed most over the years , top 10 countries where temp. Changed least over the years and top 10 countries where least change in temp. Happened. Can anyone please suggest me which plot I can use to represent these in single plot or on 3 diff. plots which can be showed side by side
5/27/20, 23:52 - Sanchit IPBA: Please note that in total there are 30 no. Of countries which I am trying to plot in 3 diff categories.
5/27/20, 23:52 - Sanchit IPBA: As of now I have used sns.barplot but the problem is with this is that it is showing each bar for each country in diff. Color so can not identify by just looking at it that the bars belong to which category
5/28/20, 08:45 - Srikanth IPBA: Can you send screenshot of the data you are plotting?
5/28/20, 08:58 - Srikanth IPBA: Use barplot only. But before that, create a new ‚Äùcategory‚Äù column and assign values - max, no change, min - to each country. When creating the barplot, add hue=‚Äôcategory‚Äô. Now you will have countries colored based on the category.
5/28/20, 10:35 - Sanchit IPBA: Thanks for your response, I will try this

6/2/20, 19:54 - Sandy IPBA: Really
6/2/20, 19:55 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Today‚Äôs session is not mandatory to join right?
6/2/20, 19:55 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: I wanted to know the same
6/2/20, 19:56 - Mazhar: Nope
6/2/20, 20:04 - Poonam IPBA: Lol
6/2/20, 20:13 - Ritu Batra IPBA: I have important conf call , can someone check with them if they can do a refresher class on the hypothesis analysis and the various methods
6/2/20, 21:43 - Babi IPBA: I see the gutsüòÄ
6/2/20, 21:47 - Kafeel IPBA: üòÇüòÇhaha
6/2/20, 21:56 - Aj IPBA: What if this session had full attendance with their respective names. And one student was absent. üëÄ üòÇ
6/2/20, 21:59 - Mazhar: A long way from the first day when somebody logged in by Moses' name
6/2/20, 22:01 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Guys please summarise today‚Äôs session
6/2/20, 22:01 - Mazhar: My takeaway regarding placement: IIM is barely involved in placement support,
It is Jigsaw that handles this department,
The placement commitee formed by us, just means using our network to find job openings and fix interviews for ourselves
6/2/20, 22:01 - Mazhar: What do others think?
6/2/20, 22:02 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Is this course worth the money spent??
6/2/20, 22:05 - Mazhar: The contacts we make, and the "IIM" tag might make up for the money,

But the study material; I dont think so, the coursera and Udemy courses are better
6/2/20, 22:06 - Mazhar: Any thoughts?
6/2/20, 22:10 - Manasi IPBA: Couldn't agree more
6/2/20, 22:11 - Shankar IPBA: Yes I think so too.... Def we need to do some extra outside the materials provided
6/2/20, 22:11 - Manasi IPBA: Also the certificate we get , it's written powered by jigsaw academy
6/2/20, 22:12 - Poonam IPBA: So far I don‚Äôt think its worth. I was expecting regular assignments and practice sessions apart from weekend classes. If people were so consistent with self studies and problem solving in such a technical course then we would have literally done that through udemy and coursera. Also, if the quality of content and course is like this, then I don‚Äôt think companies would be hiring us just for the IIM tag.
6/2/20, 22:13 - Ankit Singh IPBA: Yes ! I agree with you ! We should receive more practice material!
6/2/20, 22:13 - Ankit Singh IPBA: Theory is good no doubt
6/2/20, 22:13 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Why dont we connect with first batch who completed this course..??
6/2/20, 22:13 - Ankit Singh IPBA: But we need to practice also
6/2/20, 22:14 - Mazhar: Great idea
6/2/20, 22:14 - Ankit Singh IPBA: How?
6/2/20, 22:14 - Amit Chopra IPBA: LinkedIn
6/2/20, 22:14 - Poonam IPBA: Also, they have taken 4 batches in 1.5 yrs of beginning of this course. Given the market competition and slowdown, they should focus on existing batches and their placements rather than promoting for 5th and 6th batches. So far i know they are going to start a new batch from this month or i guess already started. IPBA 5th ...
6/2/20, 22:15 - Mazhar: I asked Moses about it once and he said that JLC has a forum on it,
But its not good to connect and have casual conversations
6/2/20, 22:15 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Moses told they are on JLC ?
6/2/20, 22:16 - Amit Chopra IPBA: I have few of them added on my LinkedIn. We should check with them
6/2/20, 22:16 - Mazhar: As a group, its no use.
We can connect with everyone individually,
But we need to connect with them as a group, like on whatsapp
6/2/20, 22:16 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Mazhar is right, it‚Äôs difficult to connect on JLC
6/2/20, 22:17 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: We Can ask Jigsaw to arrange a conference with paased out batches especially who got placed....let it be official... we can say it will be part of our guidance... through course...
6/2/20, 22:17 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Yeah, that‚Äôs a great idea
6/2/20, 22:17 - Poonam IPBA: We should
6/2/20, 22:18 - Mazhar: Great
6/2/20, 22:19 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Anyone can draft a mail on this to ipbasupport on behalf of course....
6/2/20, 22:20 - Mazhar: Couldn't we just text Mosesüòê
6/2/20, 22:33 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: My money is f***ed up üòµüòµ
6/2/20, 22:35 - Poonam IPBA: Not really, if we take a call timely and collectively it will defined help us all. Also, by taking feedback of the previous batch we can act upon it proactively üôÇ
6/2/20, 22:35 - Poonam IPBA: definitely *
6/2/20, 22:37 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: I literally joined this course knowing that IIM Indore is providing this course and spent all money to show off the IIM certificate but after all these I guess I have no idea what to do now
6/2/20, 22:38 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Wait we are not getting certificate from IIM?

6/23/20, 12:47 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: anyone has any idea how to solve this?
6/23/20, 12:54 - Debraj Saha IPBA: Use prediction instead of predict in ROCR package
6/23/20, 12:55 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: still the same error
6/23/20, 12:59 - Prashik Patil IPBA: Used all place prediction where predict mention

I don't think so...hence u r getting error
6/23/20, 13:40 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: I did
6/23/20, 13:41 - Debraj Saha IPBA: Ok
6/23/20, 13:41 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: has anyone done this in R or python and can share the code?

6/27/20, 09:35 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Yes I have...
6/27/20, 09:35 - Akash Mannari IPBA: Not able to crack it.
Still on it
6/27/20, 09:51 - Srikanth IPBA: Yes. But still working on it. Lots of questions üò∂
6/27/20, 09:52 - Neerav IPBA: If you guys know how to get deviances let me know üôÑ
6/27/20, 09:53 - Akash Mannari IPBA: Python gives you different deviance value from R.
6/27/20, 09:54 - Akash Mannari IPBA: Trying to figure out the right code for it.
6/27/20, 10:00 - Srikanth IPBA: Extract ‚Äùnull.deviance‚Äù and ‚Äùdeviance‚Äù attributes out of your result object. Deviance is residual deviance. I got values but not sure if they are correct
6/27/20, 10:31 - Akash Mannari IPBA: https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter1/1_4_0_conditional_probability.php#:~:text=From%20Equation%201.5%2C%20P(B,P(C%7CB).&text=Combining%20Equation%201.6%20and%201.7,C%7CA%2CB).&text=In%20a%20factory%20there%20are,the%20100%20units%20at%20random.

6/27/20, 12:29 - Avinash IPBA: My copy paste networking
6/27/20, 12:29 - Avinash IPBA: not working
6/27/20, 12:29 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Mine also not working
6/27/20, 12:30 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: I think it is disabled....
6/27/20, 12:30 - Tultul IPBA: Same here
6/27/20, 12:31 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: Guys are you all ok with today Class?
Maybe I'm wrong but seems we have to speak to Jigsaw for re lecture
6/27/20, 12:32 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: No use.... Jigsaw dont take chance with IIM prof... they are assets for jigsaw....
6/27/20, 12:32 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: I think its more of self study from now on....
6/27/20, 12:33 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: quality of lecture is poor
6/27/20, 12:34 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: I think the content is fine but the delivery is poor...
6/27/20, 12:34 - Abhinav IPBA: Quality is really poor
6/27/20, 12:35 - Abhinav IPBA: Need to put this issue in front of Jigsaw or else they will think everything is going fine
6/27/20, 12:35 - Tultul IPBA: Instead of charging a huge amount for this kind of pathetic lecture, jigsaw could have provided us course syllabus. We would have studied by our own.
6/27/20, 12:35 - Avinash IPBA: I see my money is gone for waste
6/27/20, 12:37 - Poonam IPBA: Exactly
6/27/20, 12:37 - Poonam IPBA: No
6/27/20, 12:37 - Surupa IPBA: I too feel the same.
6/27/20, 12:39 - Aditi IPBA: We should tell Moses. Or write to Jitendra
6/27/20, 12:40 - Susandeep IPBA: I started loosing interest when no pen üñä or marker. Couldn‚Äôt able to connect with that interest
6/27/20, 12:40 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: I agree...we must speak ASAP...
6/27/20, 12:40 - Aditi IPBA: I guess Jitendra is program coordinator from jigsaw
6/27/20, 12:40 - Aditi IPBA: Exactly
6/27/20, 12:41 - Sakshi IPBA: Yes pls we need to speak to them...it's gettt same with every lecture now
6/27/20, 12:41 - Sakshi IPBA: Getting**
6/27/20, 12:41 - Susandeep IPBA: These are basic accessories for online classes
6/27/20, 12:41 - Sakshi IPBA: Logistics got messed up...thought this atleast wud be good but it's again same
6/27/20, 12:42 - Susandeep IPBA: We should inform Jitendra about this.
6/27/20, 12:42 - Aditi IPBA: Even the materials in jlc are not very elaborate
6/27/20, 12:42 - Sakshi IPBA: I didn't find anything in jlc for today's class...
6/27/20, 12:42 - Sakshi IPBA: Is it there?
6/27/20, 12:43 - Aditi IPBA: I am talking about the previous sessions
6/27/20, 12:43 - Aditi IPBA: I didn't check for today's class
6/27/20, 12:46 - Susandeep IPBA: Jigsaw has to understand that all trainers or teachers are not good at online teaching. They may be good F2F not online. 
We aren‚Äôt against any trainers but we need to improved delivery
6/27/20, 12:46 - Sanchit IPBA: Professor could have used pen or Paint atleast to explain some examples like other professors do
6/27/20, 12:47 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: How to inform Jitendra reg these issues?
6/27/20, 12:47 - Sanchit IPBA: This really makes a difference while grasping the concepts and understand the story behind the scenes
6/27/20, 12:48 - Sakshi IPBA: Yes correct..prof Harshal was so good with that
6/27/20, 12:48 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: I think one way is that we fill up a Google form and share all the responses with Jitendra
6/27/20, 12:49 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: <Media omitted>
6/27/20, 12:50 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: <Media omitted>
6/27/20, 12:50 - Susandeep IPBA: Yeah this is good
6/27/20, 12:50 - Abhinav IPBA: Can we add a comment section here too? Everybody can write things here and could inform Jigsaw in a better way
6/27/20, 12:50 - Abhinav IPBA: ?
6/27/20, 12:51 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: Ya thisbis possible in remarks
6/27/20, 12:51 - Abhinav IPBA: Right
6/27/20, 12:51 - Sanchit IPBA: Seems like a great idea if everyone can enter their comments as well
6/27/20, 12:51 - Saili IPBA: Most of the sessions are self study üôÑ
6/27/20, 12:52 - Sanchit IPBA: <Media omitted>
6/27/20, 12:52 - Poonam IPBA: True, even I couldn‚Äôt
6/27/20, 12:53 - Sanchit IPBA: Only best thing Prof. did today was to mention this book, just search for page no. 90 for NB
6/27/20, 12:53 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: <Media omitted>
6/27/20, 12:54 - Abhinav IPBA: Looks good
6/27/20, 12:54 - Abhinav IPBA: Request you to share the link please
6/27/20, 12:54 - Aditi IPBA: We understand self study is required because time frame is short. But at least the class should make the concept clear n lucid so that we can assimilate properly while doing self study.
6/27/20, 12:56 - Mazhar: guys just watch a youtube video on frequentist vs bayesian stats
6/27/20, 12:57 - Mazhar: I have lost hope with the teaching,
so I'm all for self study,
Even though R is becoming obsolete, we are still taught in R,

Get us a better platform to connect with the other batch students, because they can guide us better, and not provide cherry picked statements lime lighting IIM and Jigsaw, we need useful info about what to expect about the future, how is the job outlook, how good is jigsaw placement portal, how and what is the placement assistance  like, what should we do apart from the lectures,

the forum on JLC is just bad, we cannot talk easy and freely,
ask Moses to create a whatsapp group with all IPBA students first,

we need first hand knowledge from the students themselves
6/27/20, 12:57 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: Yes please
6/27/20, 12:58 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: Hello all
I'm sharing the link below. Please make it atleast 50% and above so that we share with Jitendra today only
6/27/20, 12:58 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQmpNyCsomDd5ZJLM3gmI2q_uTwWnDIoLWMg9A4WYoo9z8Lg/viewform?usp=sf_link
6/27/20, 13:00 - Aditi IPBA: Should name of respondents be included here?
6/27/20, 13:00 - Mazhar: done, but add in a feature for name
6/27/20, 13:01 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: Done
6/27/20, 13:01 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: I'm not receiving any names
6/27/20, 13:01 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: Shall I add one field for name too
6/27/20, 13:01 - Aditi IPBA: Yes
6/27/20, 13:01 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Yes
6/27/20, 13:03 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: I have added field
6/27/20, 13:05 - Mazhar: add that we need it in python as well, or just comment the same
6/27/20, 13:05 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: Better to write in comment
6/27/20, 13:07 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Using puthon accuracy is coming ~ .80 and that is not in options üò¢
6/27/20, 13:11 - Mazhar: are you guys up for a joint whatsapp group with all IPBA alumni and new batch students?, I'll ask moses
6/27/20, 13:13 - Surupa IPBA: Yeah. Great idea.It would connect all of us.
6/27/20, 13:14 - Mazhar: I'm up for it, but looks like no one is remotely interested!
6/27/20, 13:21 - Poonam IPBA: I agree
6/27/20, 13:22 - Mazhar: Good Afternoon,
The forum to connect with other batch students is way too complicated and impractical for quick chats.

We need a better way to contact the former students as it will give us first hand knowledge of what to expect in the future and even expand our network. They might guide us well.

Request you to create a group with all IPBA students on whatsapp, so that we can connect.

You will not be able to create a group on whatsapp yourself and add everyone as there is a limit on max no. of people you can add as an admin.

So you'll have to create an invitation link and send it to the students,
just put the link to on the whatsapp group you might have for the other batches, those who are interested could join in
6/27/20, 13:22 - Mazhar: I'm gonna send this, want me to make some changes"?
6/27/20, 13:25 - Preeti IPBA: Even i have seen great learning portal they are very good in terms of teaching
6/27/20, 13:26 - Mazhar: ?what do you mean?
6/27/20, 13:26 - Preeti IPBA: They are teaching everything in latest like python and all
6/27/20, 13:26 - Aditi IPBA: Of great lakes?
6/27/20, 13:26 - Preeti IPBA: Ya same
6/27/20, 13:27 - Neerav IPBA: You could mention the drawbacks of the JLC platform to connect with alumni and hence the need for it
6/27/20, 13:27 - Neerav IPBA: Otherwise they‚Äôll kee repeating the same point
6/27/20, 13:27 - Neerav IPBA: Keep*
6/27/20, 13:28 - Neerav IPBA: They won‚Äôt really comprehend complicated and impractical -_-
6/27/20, 13:30 - Mazhar: I am fine with this. Just a suggestion- we can get the list of students with their phone details and do this ourselves. Else they are likely to take longer.
6/27/20, 13:30 - Mazhar: I have no contacts with the former batches,
Those who do please come up
6/27/20, 13:30 - Mazhar: We could create our own group by contacting the batches ourselves as well
6/27/20, 13:30 - Tultul IPBA: ‚úÖ
6/27/20, 13:30 - Mazhar: Those who have contacts willing to help?
6/27/20, 13:32 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: Got 12 responses till now

6/27/20, 13:32 - Mazhar: We can creat a group and send the invite link to those we know,
Then they can forward the link amongst themselves

6/27/20, 14:48 - Sakshi IPBA: Moses hardly taking any action.  He is simply asking to write an email
6/27/20, 14:49 - Sandy IPBA: that's all happens.. i sent a long email earlier and i don't see  any change with the feedback given. Instead i feel it was a waste of time drafting that email
6/27/20, 14:52 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: What's our batch size?
6/27/20, 14:52 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: Anyone have Jitendra s email address
6/27/20, 14:53 - Sandy IPBA: no i dont..
6/27/20, 14:54 - Mazhar: 90
6/27/20, 14:58 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: Okay...it's 42 now...let's wait for 4 more than I'll share the feedback n email it
6/27/20, 14:59 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: We can email to Moses/support n if no reply in a day or so... escalate to Founder
6/27/20, 15:02 - Sandy IPBA: yes plz mark all..  request a quick connect session with the coordinator
6/27/20, 15:15 - Babi IPBA: Out of topic. Does anyone know how to handle "?" In adult data set of case study  in python ?
6/27/20, 15:16 - Neerav IPBA: We are not supposed to
6/27/20, 15:16 - Neerav IPBA: Take it as is
6/27/20, 15:18 - Babi IPBA: I beleive it needs to by converted to NaN to some value before passing to model
6/27/20, 15:18 - Babi IPBA: Python does not accept NaN value
6/27/20, 15:18 - Neerav IPBA: No the question itself states we are not supposed to treat it .
6/27/20, 15:19 - Babi IPBA: That works in R
6/27/20, 15:20 - Babi IPBA: In python I think it needs to be treated to binary or numerical value
6/27/20, 15:22 - Neerav IPBA: ‚Äò?‚Äô Is part of multiple columns , I don‚Äôt think we can assign it just one value . Like occupation has it , so does working class
6/27/20, 15:22 - Neerav IPBA: So are we supposed to fix it
6/27/20, 15:23 - Diti IPBA: This message was deleted
6/27/20, 15:23 - Babi IPBA: It's in 3 columns. How to fix that
6/27/20, 15:24 - Babi IPBA: ? Is a special char which Python doesn't accept
6/27/20, 15:24 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: ?
6/27/20, 15:24 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Doesn‚Äôt have to be fixed , treat it like another category of the categorical variable
6/27/20, 15:25 - Diti IPBA: No
6/27/20, 15:25 - Babi IPBA: Still dosent work I beleive
6/27/20, 15:25 - Ritu Batra IPBA: I renamed it to Unknown
6/27/20, 15:26 - Babi IPBA: I tried  replacing with my name

6/27/20, 16:58 - Susandeep IPBA: For 8th Question, did anyone use VIF?
6/27/20, 16:59 - Babi IPBA: Can you share
6/27/20, 17:00 - Bharat IPBA: We're are questions
6/27/20, 17:00 - Susandeep IPBA: Question 8                                                                        
If you would had fitted the model using all 14 predictors, based on their context, which variables are likely to be multicollinear?
 
‚Äúeducational.num‚Äù and ‚Äúeducation‚Äù
 
‚Äúcapital_loss‚Äù and ‚Äúhours_per_week‚Äù
 
‚ÄúNative country‚Äù and ‚Äúsex‚Äù
 
None of the above
6/27/20, 17:01 - Neerav IPBA: <Media omitted>
6/27/20, 17:01 - Neerav IPBA: I haven‚Äôt added categorical data to this
6/27/20, 17:01 - Neerav IPBA: Upon adding that , it‚Äôs showing type error
6/27/20, 17:01 - Neerav IPBA: Trying to debug that
6/27/20, 17:03 - Susandeep IPBA: its in Python.
6/27/20, 17:03 - Susandeep IPBA: anybody has tried in R?
6/27/20, 17:03 - Babi IPBA: How are you treating NaN
6/27/20, 17:04 - Neerav IPBA: I put it as unknown and treating it as a categorical data and like I said I haven‚Äôt added that to it .
6/27/20, 17:05 - Neerav IPBA: The more I get into it , the more I realize it not made for python.
6/27/20, 17:05 - Neerav IPBA: This exercise
6/27/20, 17:05 - Neerav IPBA: Its*
6/27/20, 17:06 - Romita IPBA: In R you can omit missing values
6/27/20, 17:07 - Romita IPBA: na.omit(Dataset)
6/27/20, 17:09 - Babi IPBA: Putting unknown still get you type conversation error when making categorical data to nuneric due to nan. The only option is to omit. But will not get close to answer
6/27/20, 17:10 - Neerav IPBA: I‚Äôll try dropping then
6/27/20, 17:10 - Neerav IPBA: <Media omitted>
6/27/20, 17:13 - Babi IPBA: Tried ? To nan to -1. Does not work
6/27/20, 17:13 - Babi IPBA: Seems to be python issue
6/27/20, 17:18 - Neerav IPBA: Still same issue even after dropping .
6/27/20, 17:19 - Romita IPBA: what u are trying to do ?
6/27/20, 17:20 - Neerav IPBA: Check multico by vif
6/27/20, 18:20 - Susandeep IPBA: vif is not working properly
6/27/20, 18:21 - Susandeep IPBA: can anyone share Q8 code?
6/27/20, 20:13 - Bharat IPBA: Some one mail python codes bharatmahato038@gmail.com
6/27/20, 20:29 - Srikanth IPBA: Vif is not working for categorical in python.
6/27/20, 20:30 - Neerav IPBA: Welcome to the club
6/27/20, 20:30 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: Is it working in R ?
6/27/20, 20:31 - Neerav IPBA: What error are you getting ?
6/27/20, 20:32 - Srikanth IPBA: question. If we use chi-square for checking cat-cat collinearity, this is not the same as multicollinearity as we would be ignoring other variables, is that right?
6/27/20, 20:32 - Srikanth IPBA: <Media omitted>
6/27/20, 20:33 - Neerav IPBA: Show me where you have assigned the categorical variables for vif
6/27/20, 20:33 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: There are aliased coefficients in the model
6/27/20, 20:53 - Mazhar: Hi there,
Our batch (4th)  students thought it would be great if all the students of all the batches of IPBA could connect together on Whatsapp, 

It would be great for all of us, we could expand our professional network and be of use to each other immediately as well as in the future.

You can join the Whatsapp group by this link: 
https://chat.whatsapp.com/BmUZ3dut17MB6ECk7OLaoR

Or you could ping me on 8463012230 Whatsapp and I could add you to the group.

Please forward this message to your batchmates as well. It will be of great help.

Thanks
6/27/20, 20:53 - Mazhar: copy the text, change the phone number and forward this msg on Linkdin/whatsapp with whomever you have contact with in the former batches
6/27/20, 21:39 - Somebody Awesome IPBA: It seems calculation of VIF for multicollearity in Python is not straightforwardüòüüò•..especially when it involves categorical variables (in which case chi-square could be used to identify the correlation of the individual pairs )...can someone direct me to a good read on VIF ( for categorical variables, also using dummy variables cud be an option)?
6/27/20, 21:40 - Somebody Awesome IPBA: Thanks Mazhar
6/27/20, 21:41 - Pruthvi IPBA: Thanks for taking initiation , 
It will be useful for many‚úåüèªüëèüèª

6/28/20, 10:03 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: But what's the purpose of attending when yesterday lecture us bot clear too
6/28/20, 10:03 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: Seems they might take time to put things into action
6/28/20, 10:03 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: That's true actually
6/28/20, 10:03 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: They don't want to come in front bcoz feedback is from 70% batch
6/28/20, 10:04 - Saurav Samantaray IPBA: Yup
6/28/20, 10:10 - Susandeep IPBA: @919829023237 thanks for effort buddy. With due respect it won‚Äôt be appropriate to ask anything to Jigsaw here. Let‚Äôs wait for this week and see how the team is responding as per Moses mail.
6/28/20, 10:10 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: Well my money is hard earned
6/28/20, 10:10 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: Which I have invested
6/28/20, 10:12 - Susandeep IPBA: Everyone‚Äôs money is hard earned. We supported you and raised concern as a team. So have patience
6/28/20, 10:12 - Avi IPBA: Agree üëçüèª
6/28/20, 10:13 - Neerav IPBA: I think to relay the same issue to iim by jigsaw is a problem for them . We‚Äôre holding jigsaw accountable as we should , not sure about them being able to hold IIM accountable for it .
6/28/20, 10:13 - Susandeep IPBA: True
6/28/20, 10:24 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: They feel it's my individual request
6/28/20, 10:32 - Shankar IPBA: We have provided them with a list of feedback how can they feel it's from you and not from half the batch
6/28/20, 10:33 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: Good if batch is together
6/28/20, 10:44 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: Spoke to Moses...most probably they will revert for both lectures again with another faculty
6/28/20, 10:44 - Neerav IPBA: Your efforts weren‚Äôt in vain then üôåüèΩ

7/4/20, 11:03 - Sanchit IPBA: 1 star
7/4/20, 11:03 - Rajesh IPBA: Pls rate - not rating means overall rating will go up
7/4/20, 11:03 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Shameless people!
7/4/20, 11:03 - Amit Chopra IPBA: They don‚Äôt even listen
7/4/20, 11:04 - Suyash Tibrawala IPBA: then lowest rating it is
7/4/20, 11:04 - Rajesh IPBA: If we are dropping, let‚Äôs rejoin and rate at 12:15 to rate
7/4/20, 11:04 - Rajesh IPBA: Saurabh - need your help again I guess - one more poll.
7/4/20, 11:07 - Babi IPBA: I hv dropped and would not even rate. Have messaged Moses
7/4/20, 11:13 - Susandeep IPBA: Trying hard to understand with audio only. It‚Äôs a kind of audio lecture. No notepad nor üñä /markers making it‚Äôs difficult to focus
7/4/20, 11:14 - Neerav IPBA: Podcast session üòÇ
7/4/20, 11:14 - Susandeep IPBA: üòÇ
7/4/20, 11:15 - Susandeep IPBA: Time series podcast

7/4/20, 11:19 - Neerav IPBA: I‚Äôm not even on the same page of his ppt üôÉ
7/4/20, 11:19 - Swarnapava Ray IPBA: Such a boring lecture. It's good u r not attending.
7/4/20, 11:19 - Swarnapava Ray IPBA: üòÅüòÅ
7/4/20, 11:20 - Srikanth IPBA: I'm concentrating on eating my dosa
7/4/20, 11:20 - Neerav IPBA: I just had my breakfast alongside too üòÇ
7/4/20, 11:20 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: We can do but I think we should write on that thread only
7/4/20, 11:21 - Avinash IPBA: We are loosing approx 4.3 K every such boring lecture‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è
7/4/20, 11:21 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: full of breaks.. :D
7/4/20, 11:22 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: now the official one
7/4/20, 11:22 - Neerav IPBA: Its R now , time to switch off üß∏
7/4/20, 11:22 - Bharat IPBA: Without pen The goes like a boaring
7/4/20, 11:24 - Swarnapava Ray IPBA: There is no Python class for Statistical modelling. It's all R. Jigsaw is making us fool.
7/4/20, 11:24 - Dinesh IPBA: Let us rate poor
7/4/20, 11:24 - Neerav IPBA: I‚Äôll try the rpy2 package in he meantime
7/4/20, 11:24 - Neerav IPBA: The*
7/4/20, 11:24 - Rahul IPBA: Guys. Give him 1 rating. Let's management take call against today's session. I am not happy with today's session. I have attended time series session before. This is one of the worst.
7/4/20, 11:25 - Swarnapava Ray IPBA: This Prof does want to move his hands to write anything. Only speaking üò¢
7/4/20, 11:26 - Neerav IPBA: He needs to get a pen tab
7/4/20, 11:26 - Neerav IPBA: Since teaching is gonna be this way for time to come
7/4/20, 11:27 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: i will rate him 1 for sure
7/4/20, 11:28 - Sourabh Patil IPBA: We can do least one thing let them teach in R for now and ask them to send code for both R and python so we can practice in python
7/4/20, 11:28 - Manasi IPBA: Yes.
7/4/20, 11:28 - Manasi IPBA: That way we can know the syntax and commands to be used .
7/4/20, 11:28 - Abhinav IPBA: Good idea
7/4/20, 11:29 - Diti IPBA: Agreed
7/4/20, 11:29 - Abhinav IPBA: Or else inform them to conduct a session of the same in python
7/4/20, 11:29 - Bharat IPBA: But he only knows r programming -sujay
7/4/20, 11:29 - Dr Kalyan Parimi IPBA: he will ask you to convert it yourelf, like last time,
7/4/20, 11:29 - Bharat IPBA: Yes
7/4/20, 11:30 - Neerav IPBA: Has anyone tried converting ?
7/4/20, 11:30 - Bharat IPBA: Our break time over come to zoom
7/4/20, 11:30 - Poonam IPBA: Initial lectures were actually good ones but now week by week quality has deteriorated ... IPBA team is just doing formality but 3+ lacs for accessing mediocre and below average course content and lectures is just too much. No one can guarantee placements if taught so superficially...
7/4/20, 11:31 - Dr Kalyan Parimi IPBA: yes if its standard program it does get transformed into proper python script using RPY2 package
7/4/20, 11:31 - Poonam IPBA: People from technical background can still manage but it‚Äôs nightmare for people like me. üòì
7/4/20, 11:32 - Poonam IPBA: Yes
7/4/20, 11:32 - Bharat IPBA: What happened you facing difficult to understand
7/4/20, 11:33 - Neerav IPBA: If it works , could you send the python file for the conversion ?
7/4/20, 11:33 - Poonam IPBA: Yes... since last three weeks. It‚Äôs really fast paced
7/4/20, 11:34 - Dr Kalyan Parimi IPBA: yeah sure, let me try to convert today's code,
7/4/20, 11:34 - Sanchit IPBA: Can anyone please share whatever alt. source you are using to understand and practice time series ?
7/4/20, 11:34 - Neerav IPBA: I‚Äôm just YouTubing all of it .
7/4/20, 11:35 - Neerav IPBA: People usually include the dataset they‚Äôre working on , for us to practice along side
7/4/20, 11:37 - Neerav IPBA: Thanks üòÅ
7/4/20, 11:37 - Swarnapava Ray IPBA: Agreed
7/4/20, 11:40 - Surupa IPBA: I had an interaction with Moses.  He said to rate him 1. Only then, they can take up the issue.
7/4/20, 11:46 - Sourabh Patil IPBA: üëç
7/4/20, 11:47 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: everyone...please stick to this rating
7/4/20, 11:48 - Sakshi IPBA: Yes
7/4/20, 11:48 - Sakshi IPBA: Will do
7/4/20, 11:48 - Preeti IPBA: Yesüëç
7/4/20, 11:48 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: I always give 1 xD
7/4/20, 11:59 - Avinash IPBA: We are having assignment 4 next week as per the schedule...with this kind of poor lectures how to complete??ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢
7/4/20, 12:00 - Dr Kalyan Parimi IPBA: <Media omitted>
7/4/20, 12:15 - Srikanth IPBA: Can we do the poll first and the class later. This is tiring üò¥
7/4/20, 12:22 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: This message was deleted
7/4/20, 12:23 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Thank you
7/4/20, 12:41 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Can we unanimously decide not to attend tomorrow‚Äôs session unless Jigsaw provides us a better alternative
7/4/20, 12:42 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Well I don‚Äôt mind if everyone is up for it but I don‚Äôt think they care about it
7/4/20, 12:42 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: They have their money
7/4/20, 12:43 - Ritu Batra IPBA: They would, if none of us attends unless they resolve our concerns
7/4/20, 12:43 - Ritu Batra IPBA: We can definitely make the rating of their courses poor
7/4/20, 12:44 - Ritu Batra IPBA: We have paid a huge sum and hence they are accountable to us
7/4/20, 12:45 - Ritu Batra IPBA: But yes, it‚Äôll work only if we all are thinking same
7/4/20, 12:48 - Sakshi IPBA: I agree...let's do that
7/4/20, 12:50 - Dinesh IPBA: +1
7/4/20, 12:53 - Ritu Batra IPBA: If we get enough mandate I can drop a mail to Moses in continuation to the earlier mail , letting him know our resolve
7/4/20, 12:58 - Sandy IPBA: i am in for it
7/4/20, 12:58 - Sandy IPBA: its anyways a waste of time

7/4/20, 15:52 - Dalvendra IPBA: I am in
7/4/20, 15:52 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Sending the following to Moses
7/4/20, 15:52 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Hi Moses, Hope this finds you in the best of health. We the Batch 4 , IPBA are not satisfied with the way the sessions are being conducted. Today‚Äôs session completely lacked the clarity . We have brought our concerns to Jigsaws notice earlier as well. I hope Jigsaw understands that we have not joined this course to merely earn a certificate. Most of us are working professionals and we are here to gain knowledge so as to be able to implement that in our work. 
We don‚Äôt want to waste our weekend time attending sessions which are adding no value. Hence some of us have decided not to be part of tomorrow‚Äôs session, unless Jigsaw looks into the quality of the lectures being imparted.
7/4/20, 15:52 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Please review and send me your feedback
7/4/20, 15:53 - Avinash IPBA: üëç

7/4/20, 16:05 - Ritu Batra IPBA: <Media omitted>

7/4/20, 19:28 - Dr Kalyan Parimi IPBA: <Media omitted>
7/4/20, 19:28 - Dr Kalyan Parimi IPBA: In this we have code breakdown
7/4/20, 19:40 - Neerav IPBA: Have you done the conversion code in this notebook itself ?
7/4/20, 19:41 - Neerav IPBA: I wanted to go through that as well
7/4/20, 19:42 - Dr Kalyan Parimi IPBA: The conversion did work out for few modules, but for functions in time series, we already have a library pre-present, so i didnt use conversion
7/4/20, 19:48 - Neerav IPBA: Alright , thanks for the help!
7/4/20, 23:32 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Guys I hope the ones who agreed are not going to attend the class tomorrow
7/4/20, 23:33 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: I would be fast asleep üò¥
7/4/20, 23:33 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Or doing my video work
7/4/20, 23:33 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Lazy Sunday
7/4/20, 23:34 - Aditi IPBA: Will they conduct open session tomorrow?
7/4/20, 23:34 - Swarnapava Ray IPBA: Yaa. Will not attend lecture tomorrow
7/4/20, 23:35 - Ritu Batra IPBA: üëç
7/4/20, 23:35 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Honestly, I think it won‚Äôt make a difference! Ideally, no one should attend the class tomorrow. If anyone of us will attend the class, then the class will be counted
7/4/20, 23:35 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Don‚Äôt know, haven‚Äôt received any information yet
7/4/20, 23:36 - Aditi IPBA: Okk
7/4/20, 23:36 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: Point is that how concern they are
7/4/20, 23:36 - Dr Kalyan Parimi IPBA: @919310922196 can probably call some zoom bombers from youtube world for us, it would be a nightmare for jigsaw
7/4/20, 23:36 - Ritu Batra IPBA: I Concur , but every one is free to decide what they want , no hard feelings
7/4/20, 23:37 - Ritu Batra IPBA: üòÄüòÄ
7/4/20, 23:37 - Swayam IPBA: Let's all join at 12:30 to rate him 1
7/4/20, 23:38 - Ritu Batra IPBA: üòÄüòÄ
7/4/20, 23:38 - Amit Chopra IPBA: In the college days, we used to mass bunk the lectures whenever we had problems with the professors! Similarly, we all have to come together. It‚Äôs not about 1 lecture, it‚Äôs about the future lectures also
7/4/20, 23:38 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: It will not help us
7/4/20, 23:38 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: Last class we gave poor ratings
7/4/20, 23:39 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: But same
7/4/20, 23:39 - Ritu Batra IPBA: We cannot let them take us for a ride
7/4/20, 23:48 - Abhinav IPBA: BestüòÇ

7/5/20, 09:44 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Well even the weather of Delhi says so
7/5/20, 09:49 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Haha üòÇ true
7/5/20, 09:50 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Super awesome weather

7/5/20, 09:59 - Sakshi IPBA: Even I am not joining
7/5/20, 09:59 - Sakshi IPBA: Did we hear anything from Moses for open discussion
7/5/20, 10:00 - Babi IPBA: I am off tooüëç
7/5/20, 10:09 - Surupa IPBA: Hi everyone, I interacted with Moses. He told that there will be an open office session between Jigsaw and IIM. However, he asked to send a mail like the previous one.
7/5/20, 10:13 - Aditi IPBA: I also haven't joined
7/5/20, 10:14 - Prasanna IPBA: Me neither.
7/5/20, 10:17 - Siddharth IPBA: Mass bunk..!!üòõ
7/5/20, 10:18 - Siddharth IPBA: If only this would‚Äôve been a normal college lecture...
We all could‚Äôve gone somewhere to chill outüòõüòÇ
7/5/20, 10:20 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: Meet up in zoom and watch pirated movie.. college feels guaranteed
7/5/20, 10:20 - Siddharth IPBA: Lol
7/5/20, 10:20 - Poonam IPBA: We used to call it GT during my college days.
7/5/20, 10:20 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: I'm off too üëçüëç
7/5/20, 10:22 - Manasi IPBA: GT ?
7/5/20, 10:23 - Sandy IPBA: üòÄüòÄüòÄüëç so true
7/5/20, 10:23 - Poonam IPBA: ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ç‡§™ ‡§§‡§°‡§º‡•Ä
7/5/20, 10:24 - Manasi IPBA: Accha
7/5/20, 10:24 - Sandy IPBA: and pune weather is like a hill station right now...  no plans to attend this lecture..
7/5/20, 10:26 - Boojashree IPBA: Is anyone attending ?but I see the classes are going on
7/5/20, 10:27 - Srikanth IPBA: In that email, could you please mention the pathetic quality of JLC videos. Also, the main header on the website says ‚ÄùStatistical modeling in Python‚Äù while they teach everything in R
7/5/20, 10:27 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: Babi is gonna remve anyone who attends todays session
7/5/20, 10:28 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: How to check who all the attending?
7/5/20, 10:28 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: Moses will send absent list
7/5/20, 10:29 - Dr Kalyan Parimi IPBA: Shall we ask mosesüòÇ
7/5/20, 10:29 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Hahahaha let me see if we can see or not
7/5/20, 10:29 - Boojashree IPBA: Even Iam trying check
7/5/20, 10:29 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: <Media omitted>
7/5/20, 10:29 - Boojashree IPBA: I think the only option is through the chat
7/5/20, 10:29 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: It‚Äôs just 2 people I guess
7/5/20, 10:29 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: 3
7/5/20, 10:29 - Siddharth IPBA: Yesssss
7/5/20, 10:30 - Boojashree IPBA: How to check ?
7/5/20, 10:30 - Amit Chopra IPBA: To check, People will have to join ü§£
7/5/20, 10:30 - Boojashree IPBA: Then I don‚Äôt even want to check
7/5/20, 10:31 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: take a stand
7/5/20, 10:31 - Aj IPBA: I have not joined.
7/5/20, 10:31 - Babi IPBA: Two are definitely out of this group
7/5/20, 10:31 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: wither attend or not... you wont gain much either way
7/5/20, 10:31 - Gaurav Mahajan IPBA: Mosses will send attendance in a while
7/5/20, 10:31 - Babi IPBA: Bharat and Laks R
7/5/20, 10:31 - Manasi IPBA: üòÇ
7/5/20, 10:31 - Gaurav Mahajan IPBA: üôà
7/5/20, 10:31 - Babi IPBA: I don't see shreya in this group so don't care much
7/5/20, 10:33 - Aj IPBA: I don‚Äôt think jigsaw realising this that one batch can ruin their complete IPBA program with negative comments and reviews. They have to take us seriously.
7/5/20, 10:33 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Yes they ain‚Äôt taking it seriously
7/5/20, 10:34 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: have faith in internet this only batch 4
7/5/20, 10:34 - Poonam IPBA: True and consequences could be more serious for them...
7/5/20, 10:34 - Manasi IPBA: This is because the previous batches dont seem to have a problem with the faculties
7/5/20, 10:34 - Surupa IPBA: Can we circulate a Google form and then give a mail, it would give a better impact.
7/5/20, 10:35 - Manasi IPBA: I talked with one of them from batch 3 , she was like , almost all the professors teach the same way . You will understand things only when you revisit them while preparing for tests.
7/5/20, 10:35 - Aj IPBA: Or maybe they had but were not vocal and didn‚Äôt stand for it
7/5/20, 10:35 - Rajesh IPBA: Plan to attend around 12:15 and give a 1 rating
7/5/20, 10:35 - Poonam IPBA: Exactly
7/5/20, 10:36 - Aj IPBA: This is ^chalta hai^ attitude, which isn‚Äôt something we are fond of.
7/5/20, 10:36 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Perfect
7/5/20, 10:37 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Because according to jigsaw rating above 1/poor means the lecture was ‚Äúgood‚Äù
7/5/20, 10:38 - Poonam IPBA: The reason they are taking 4-5 batches in just 1.5 years of initiation of program. Their focus isn‚Äôt on the quality for sure, just a money minting biz by luring candidates for IIM tag...which isn‚Äôt going to make much difference either if the quality is poor
7/5/20, 10:40 - Aj IPBA: Well, tbh I was also the one who got lured with IIM tag. üòú 
but that doesn‚Äôt mean won‚Äôt stand for bad(online) teaching.
7/5/20, 10:40 - Prasanna IPBA: This is bad. I thought all of us agreed yesterday. Guys, what‚Äôs the point if we aren‚Äôt taking one stand!
7/5/20, 10:40 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Are these people even in the group?
7/5/20, 10:41 - Aj IPBA: It‚Äôs fine! We always have a few üòÖ
7/5/20, 10:41 - Poonam IPBA: Of course we shouldn‚Äôt, ultimately we will be evaluated based on our tech. skills in the market and not tag.
7/5/20, 10:41 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Same xD they told me I will get a iim certification placement from them and everything
7/5/20, 10:41 - Aj IPBA: ü§£ sounds funny now!
7/5/20, 10:45 - Manasi IPBA: Same here
7/5/20, 10:45 - Manasi IPBA: But even the certificate is not worth it
7/5/20, 10:46 - Tultul IPBA: This is really bad. Any other way to check out attendees list else than chat window?
7/5/20, 10:46 - Manasi IPBA: It's a certificate from jigswa academy at first glance
7/5/20, 10:47 - Poonam IPBA: I feel like asking them for a refund if it goes like this...seems like such a hefty sum wasted. I will go in depression üòì
7/5/20, 10:47 - Poonam IPBA: Really bad yaar ...
7/5/20, 10:48 - Poonam IPBA: Has anyone actually got placed from previous batches (with/without Jigsaw support) ... how do we get to know the success ratio of previous batches. They should publicise that too.
7/5/20, 10:49 - Rajesh IPBA: I am thinking if we should escalate to iim-Indore Director
7/5/20, 10:49 - Poonam IPBA: Only rigorous self study from different sources can save... if scenario continues.
7/5/20, 10:50 - Poonam IPBA: True. They are misusing the institute‚Äôs name with such collaboration.
7/5/20, 10:54 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: I don‚Äôt think they would refund it
7/5/20, 10:55 - Shankar IPBA: They will already have a policy saying "Fees once paid will not refunded at any cost"
7/5/20, 10:55 - Poonam IPBA: True, thats service industry in india.
7/5/20, 10:55 - Manasi IPBA: Yes. There are people who have got placed
7/5/20, 10:56 - Susandeep IPBA: One of my friend, did similar course from on supply change management from iim Kolkata. He didn‚Äôt get any benefit.
7/5/20, 10:56 - Poonam IPBA: Big promises, shallow services and poorest outcomes
7/5/20, 11:00 - Amit Chopra IPBA: True üëç
7/5/20, 11:07 - Swarnapava Ray IPBA: But jigsaw has taken money for 2 campus visits. Jigsaw has to refund us if no campus visits happen.
7/5/20, 11:07 - Babi IPBA: Should these go out from this group ?
7/5/20, 11:08 - Babi IPBA: Rajesh, I am in here to escalate
7/5/20, 11:09 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: I‚Äôm up for it
7/5/20, 11:09 - Susandeep IPBA: Leave it @919822213707   Always there are some people like this.
7/5/20, 11:09 - Rajesh IPBA: And may be the Ceo of jigsaw - the lady who was in the opening meeting
7/5/20, 11:10 - Rajesh IPBA: Do you want to give this a shot Babi.. may be we need to shoot a mail to Moses and then escalate upwards
7/5/20, 11:10 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: Moses is only in charge of damage control and management
7/5/20, 11:10 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: he cant change much
7/5/20, 11:11 - Rajesh IPBA: Way I have seen - Moses does nothing. He is sandwiched between us and the jigsaw/iim team
7/5/20, 11:11 - Swarnapava Ray IPBA: We are paying. These are not free learning course. We should escalate
7/5/20, 11:13 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: i think i was one of the first ppl to give a 1 star rating to one of the sessions... Instead of addressing my concern Moses called me saying how i can give 1 star... hes was least interested in any resolution...
7/5/20, 11:16 - Rajesh IPBA: Started to go through a session on time series by great learning - on YouTube.. is a 5 hr session and have gone through for past 25 mins.. seems ok - don‚Äôt know what they do for practical‚Äôs but concept seems to be clearer
7/5/20, 11:18 - Sandy IPBA: lets draft an email and Rajesh stated to write it to the IIM director and Jigsaw CEO
7/5/20, 11:20 - Prasanna IPBA: Great learning marathon videos are amazing.
7/5/20, 11:20 - Sanchit IPBA: I am not sure about who would be the Jigsaw CEO because now Jigsaw is owned by Manipal education group
7/5/20, 11:25 - Rahul IPBA: CEO is Gaurav only and COO Sarita.
7/5/20, 11:26 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Cool, let‚Äôs draft an email together
7/5/20, 11:27 - Aditi IPBA: I don't think jigsaw will escalate matters to IIM as they are using the iim tag
7/5/20, 11:29 - Aditi IPBA: If it was not for IIM, then most of us would have enrolled for some other online courses
7/5/20, 11:30 - Rajesh IPBA: Agree
7/5/20, 11:30 - Babi IPBA: I have asked Moses to share feedback link on email so let's not get to end of session to rate it
7/5/20, 11:31 - Rajesh IPBA: Great Babi
7/5/20, 11:31 - Aditi IPBA: üëçüèª
7/5/20, 11:32 - Amit Chopra IPBA: üëç
7/5/20, 11:36 - Babi IPBA: Let's write one email to ipba support after we get feedback link
7/5/20, 11:37 - Swarnapava Ray IPBA: üëç
7/5/20, 11:39 - Amit Chopra IPBA: And also, login at the end of the session and rate him poor
7/5/20, 11:40 - Manasi IPBA: Point
7/5/20, 11:45 - Poonam IPBA: Correct
7/5/20, 11:45 - Prashik Patil IPBA: How many people join class today.
I'm not join.
7/5/20, 11:47 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: logically if u r absent ur rating should not me accounted for...
7/5/20, 11:48 - Poonam IPBA: Agree
7/5/20, 11:48 - Manasi IPBA: Yes , even I was thinking the same
7/5/20, 11:48 - Poonam IPBA: True
7/5/20, 11:49 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Even if you are there, then also they are not considering our rating ü§£
7/5/20, 11:49 - Manasi IPBA: üòÇ
7/5/20, 11:51 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: Amit u now ready to be a DAta scientist...
7/5/20, 11:52 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Already working as a data scientist! lol üòÜ
7/5/20, 11:53 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: My prediction model turned out to have 100% accuracy
7/5/20, 11:53 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: And i didnt use r or python, only watsapp
7/5/20, 11:53 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: MVP
7/5/20, 11:55 - Amit Chopra IPBA: What was your prediction
7/5/20, 11:56 - Abdul Nadaf IPBA: ‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è...ü§úü§õ
7/5/20, 12:04 - Aditi IPBA: What are they suppose to do with the R code which we have uploaded in the assignment? It is showing as not yet graded.
7/5/20, 12:11 - Manasi IPBA: But we got the results ... I don't think they are going to do anything with it
7/5/20, 12:17 - Amit Chopra IPBA: We can join now and give the rating
7/5/20, 12:33 - Rajesh IPBA: Joined - waiting for session to end
7/5/20, 12:36 - Surupa IPBA: Hello everyone, 

IIM Indore needs a strong feedback. As per them, feedback is something which they have received through email. More no. of emails from different students, more no. of feedbacks can be placed in front of them. 

So,I request everyone to write an email to Jitendra and CEO of Jigsaw ( a lady) ( don't know the name) regarding the class. 

This would help Moses and the Jigsaw team to place feedbacks on front of Prof. Pritam.

Regards
Surupa Chakravarty
7/5/20, 13:00 - Prasanna IPBA: Has it ended?
7/5/20, 13:19 - Mazhar: Yes, I would have rather joined cheaper and much better courses on Dataquest, Datacamp. , Udemy and so many more.


Given the IIM name and, "become an IIM alum" slogan, I didn't even care to research.

Money down the drainüò≠
It would take more than a years work to Breakeven the amount spent
7/5/20, 13:21 - Mazhar: One more thing I don't understand is why the other batch members don't seem interested in connecting, only about 10 joined the new group
7/5/20, 13:22 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Which new group ü•∫
7/5/20, 13:23 - Mazhar: Here you go
7/5/20, 13:26 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Thank you ü•∫

7/5/20, 15:26 - Surupa IPBA: Gave ratings at the end. I don't think it would matter much.
7/5/20, 15:30 - Surupa IPBA: Also sent a mail. If anyone feels like, do take a step give your feedback.
7/5/20, 16:31 - Dinesh IPBA: Can any one please send me code for last graded assignment-3 at dinesh.poluru@gmail.com

7/6/20, 13:19 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: XD
7/6/20, 13:20 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: well  i tried the faculty could not even explain how we are setting up the intervals
7/6/20, 13:20 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: he was like you do this
7/6/20, 13:20 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: because you will get the answer
7/6/20, 13:20 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: xD
7/6/20, 13:20 - Mazhar: just youtube
7/6/20, 13:20 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: üòÇ
7/6/20, 13:21 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: well i guess its the oly option left
7/6/20, 13:21 - Mazhar: i was checking out IPBA reviews online
a bunch of quora answers, all look like paid reviews!,
like doge says:  very vow, much detailed!
7/6/20, 14:00 - Babi IPBA: I don't see a reply yet but suggest others to reply as well
7/6/20, 15:11 - Mazhar: I follow a couple of pages like these, and get timely nuggets of information, I like this page very much

7/6/20, 17:06 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Already did
7/6/20, 17:24 - Rajesh IPBA: <Media omitted>
7/6/20, 17:26 - Neerav IPBA: Update us about the action already taken ?
7/6/20, 17:26 - Neerav IPBA: This better be good üôÑ
7/6/20, 17:27 - Rajesh IPBA: Don‚Äôt know man - they are having a chat I believe.. if things not ok, we need to escalate as I see to iim unsure director
7/6/20, 17:27 - Rajesh IPBA: Moses says -: We have collected all the feedback and shared with IIM including the what's app feedback and calls feedback
7/6/20, 17:27 - Rajesh IPBA: Let‚Äôs wait until tomorrow and decide as a group if we should escalate to iim director
7/6/20, 17:29 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Yes, even I texted Moses yesterday and he told me that they will have a meeting with IIM
7/6/20, 17:29 - Rajesh IPBA: Great - so at the moment they are consistent!! In response
7/6/20, 17:30 - Neerav IPBA: How come it took them 4 batches to release there‚Äôs a problem , what was different when this used to happen pre covid .
7/6/20, 17:30 - Neerav IPBA: Realise*
7/6/20, 17:31 - Rajesh IPBA: May be our seniors were ok with how it was taught.. I think Covid or per-Covid has no impact considering that prof Sujay taught our earlier batches the same way..
7/6/20, 17:32 - Neerav IPBA: So the earlier batches were what , happy with the mediocrity?
7/6/20, 17:32 - Neerav IPBA: Still amazed .
7/6/20, 17:33 - Rajesh IPBA: I guess we would never know neerav- may be same problem repeating but we don‚Äôt know that.. per Moses earlier batches have good feedback on prof Sujay.. but our data point is only Moses - so can never be sure
7/6/20, 17:37 - Neerav IPBA: When I looked up on  jigsaw , Moses was star for many a reviews . People already part of this course claimed him to be the best thing that happened to the course itself üòÇ. Almost gave me the feels that as a program coordinator he really must be riding the profs to get stuff done .
7/6/20, 17:37 - Neerav IPBA: üåö
7/6/20, 17:39 - Sanchit IPBA: Giving the current scenario and response rate of Moses I think he is still the best thing so far in this course üòù
7/6/20, 17:39 - Rajesh IPBA: Reviews can be doctored as all of us know. From what I see - he does not talk to iim prof
7/6/20, 17:40 - Neerav IPBA: Do let me know if any further push has to be given from my end as most of the points were already covered . Be happy to jot down more as and when anything new comes up .
7/6/20, 18:43 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Keeping my fingers crossed ü§û hope something worthwhile comes out of this
7/6/20, 21:16 - Babi IPBA: Rajesh, I had the similar response from Moses stating Sarita and Jitendra are in discussion with IIM on these issues. Seems like B4 is setting up expectation of quality deliverables from them. Not sure how previous batches survived. I would not pull Moses as he is just facilitating the schedule and other stuff.  Let's hope for the best üëç

7/8/20, 19:45 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Then let us begin the session with theory explanation first and then coding. We may have to extend beyond the allocated time
7/8/20, 19:46 - Babi IPBA: I think they are gone crazy to figure out how to fix this after seeing responses from every one.
7/8/20, 19:47 - Babi IPBA: Time series session date is not this weekend, seems to be next weekend. Check that

7/12/20, 13:00 - Mazhar: kaggle has a very steep learning curve, even the interface use is very hard,
I'd recommend to get on kaggle right away, see how everything is arranged, check datasets, and other people's notebooks, get overwhelmed and demotivated, quit, retry in a while,
AND Repeat the process.
7/12/20, 13:23 - Dr Kalyan Parimi IPBA: We've courses on different topics from scratch, (building a custom function). It's better to start with kaggle->courses - >python followed by data cleaning etc. I've been using kaggle since a two years or so. It's quite practical. You can expect something similar if you work on a project in a firm.
7/12/20, 13:28 - Rajashekhar IPBA: I got permission and installed python on my work laptop
7/12/20, 13:29 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Whatever operations i do in 3-4 minutes on excel take about 30-40 minutes on python

7/12/20, 13:29 - Rajashekhar IPBA: That's how we learn after all... Repetition a lot of repetition

7/14/20, 09:29 - Amit Chopra IPBA: üëç
7/14/20, 09:36 - Surupa IPBA: üëç They said that this is the first batch which gave such a low poll ratings to Prof.Sujoy. I think with this, they also realized that  batch 4 is vocal and has a good unity. Hope to keep up the spirit further. 
Thanks everyone who lead the discussion yesterday on behalf of everybody by accumulating all the points.
7/14/20, 09:46 - Swarnapava Ray IPBA: True. Thanks all for voicing and showing our unity.
7/14/20, 10:39 - Rajashekhar IPBA: I mean all it takes is few quora posts where everything falls from heaven for jigsaw

7/14/20, 10:43 - Rajashekhar IPBA: And if people are vocal, other party has to take you seriously or take a serious toll
7/14/20, 14:45 - Sakshi IPBA: Same

7/14/20, 18:23 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Version difference
7/14/20, 18:23 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: He was using 11
7/14/20, 18:23 - Ankit Singh IPBA: Oh!

7/14/20, 18:23 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: I guess

7/15/20, 12:55 - Neerav IPBA: <Media omitted>
7/15/20, 12:56 - Neerav IPBA: Since we already assigned the period in the decompose
7/15/20, 15:12 - Sanchit IPBA: .seasonal_decompose from statsmodels.tsa.api breaks down your Time-Series in different components of Time-Series. Those components are Trend, seasonlaity, residuals, observed, etc. From these seperated components whatever you like to fetch you can write it with your variable. 

In this case, air['AirPassengers'] time series is decomposed to its all seperate components and is being saved into decomp. 

Then you are fetching only seasonality component from this Time-Series using decomp. seasonal .

Similarly you can fetch Trend using decomp.trend and decomp.resid for residuals. 

You can see all the options available for this Time-Series just by pressing Shift+Tab after writing decomp.
7/15/20, 15:24 - Neerav IPBA: Thanks for the explanation !

7/19/20, 20:38 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Much needed...
7/19/20, 20:38 - Sandy IPBA: Other concern which I raised with Moses as why the assignment is opened only for 6 hours
7/19/20, 20:38 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Thanks for the initiative...
7/19/20, 20:39 - Sakshi IPBA: Did you hear back on this?
7/19/20, 20:39 - Sandy IPBA: during these times we hardly get time over the weekends to handle things at personal end.. and after that this 6 hours window
7/19/20, 20:40 - Sakshi IPBA: I doubt if they ll arrange any session...if they can share python R codes...that too will be helpful
7/19/20, 20:40 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Absolutely....I agree...
7/19/20, 20:40 - Sandy IPBA: His point was management took a decision, so that students cannot discuss.. i was 6 hours is equally enough to discuss whatever needs to be discussed
7/19/20, 20:41 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Absolutely
7/19/20, 20:41 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Correct
7/19/20, 20:41 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Not yet
7/19/20, 20:41 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: This is actually restricting the privilege of online learning...
7/19/20, 20:41 - Sandy IPBA: And i even mentioned its not those primitive school i am attending.. its an individual and an adult learning
7/19/20, 20:42 - Sandy IPBA: and few more points which he couldn't justify..  and requested to write an email
7/19/20, 20:42 - Sandy IPBA: above all this another  email
7/19/20, 20:42 - Sandy IPBA: üòÄüòÄ
7/19/20, 20:43 - Amit Chopra IPBA: üòÑ
7/19/20, 20:44 - Rajashekhar IPBA: They don't care üòë
7/19/20, 20:44 - Amit Chopra IPBA: I don‚Äôt know, I have started feeling that this course is only for introducing these topics to us and in the end we are going to get a certificate from IIM. That‚Äôs it! If I talk about true learning, then that‚Äôs not happening. I think so
7/19/20, 20:45 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: very true...
7/19/20, 20:45 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: They really need to revitalise the way this course is going...who puts time limit during day time...i mean it was jigsaw controlled our 6 hours of today...
7/19/20, 20:45 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: They are just touching the topics and leaving the rest to us for self study
7/19/20, 20:46 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Honestly I did self study for time series but I couldn‚Äôt relate questions to what they taught us!
7/19/20, 20:46 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Correct...
7/19/20, 20:46 - Amit Chopra IPBA: I‚Äôm from coding background as well
7/19/20, 20:46 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Even then
7/19/20, 20:47 - Sandy IPBA: Another point if students don't learn, how would they face interviews.. i was like.. that's the individual's responsibility to clear an interview.... i was don't make it difficult in these times..  And the only conclusion was please send an email..
7/19/20, 20:47 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: What Mr. Saini taught us and what we have got toay as quiz is way too much haywire
7/19/20, 20:47 - Amit Chopra IPBA: True
7/19/20, 20:48 - Avinash IPBA: I just passed today's assignment with the help of group...
7/19/20, 20:49 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: This course is not only about passing the assignments..its about what we are actually learning.
7/19/20, 20:50 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: Most of us here are well established professional , we are here to increase the scope of our knowledge
7/19/20, 20:50 - Amit Chopra IPBA: True
7/19/20, 20:50 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Anyone here from pharma domain?

7/19/20, 20:59 - Surupa IPBA: Same goes for me
7/19/20, 20:59 - Abhinav IPBA: Absolutely correct. Rather than deep diving in the theory, if they could touch upon practical part for most of the concepts, that would be great.
7/19/20, 21:03 - Poonam IPBA: True
7/19/20, 21:10 - Prashik Patil IPBA: Same here
7/19/20, 21:23 - Kafeel IPBA: I am
7/19/20, 21:24 - Sakshi IPBA: Dnt know about others but couple of ppl have reached me on LinkedIn for the feedback of this course as they all are looking to Join..I was thinking to share the screenshots with jigsaw regarding the feedback...that this is what going out in the market about jigsaw
7/19/20, 21:24 - Sakshi IPBA: After all ppl do consider review  and feedbacks before drawing any conclusions
7/19/20, 21:25 - Sakshi IPBA: May b then they work on their model
7/19/20, 21:30 - Rajashekhar IPBA: I shall write a beautiful review today
7/19/20, 21:33 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: I dropped a mail to them, don't think anything is going to happen

7/25/20, 09:22 - Poonam IPBA: If Corona had to make a CV, here's how it would read:

1. Responsible for Global Digital Transformation.

2.Reduction of Global CO2 emission.

3.Five million job cuts.

4.Global Hygiene initiatives: 
Ensured 100% compliance on washing hands.

5. Made industry shift to WFH - saved exposure and costs.

6. Reduction in noise pollution by making everyone keep their mouth shut (masked).

7. Taught cooking, vegetable shopping, housekeeping to many

8. Provided ample time to all egoistic and self centered people,  to contemplate on their mortal nature.

9. Provided a big boost to the Pharma sector and brought back small utility stores back into the limelight

10. Highlighted the importance of governance, adaptability and long term planning, by all sectors

Corona‚Äôs CV would look better than that of many CEO's!üòÉüòÉ

8/8/20, 21:21 - Babi IPBA: I did a simple trick to enroll. Follow this one.
Configure your IIm email on smartphone
Then go to corsera from your smartphone and click on register.
Use Google credentials as option and when prompted choose your IIm account bfrom list.
Done
8/8/20, 21:23 - Mazhar: does it work as a student account though?
can you access paid only assignments?
8/8/20, 21:24 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: really is it working??
8/8/20, 21:26 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: this activity you can do on desktop website as well using sign up option... but will only register you...
8/8/20, 21:27 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: I think the coursera is yet to identify our  IIM IDs as student IDs
8/8/20, 21:27 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Yes
8/8/20, 21:35 - Babi IPBA: You have a option to link your account as student. Though it did not work. Looks like IIM is not yet enrolled. This is what I can read from message displayed
8/9/20, 09:11 - Mazhar: <Media omitted>
8/9/20, 10:05 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Strange, i didn‚Äôt receive this email and moreover, we have already completed sql assignment
8/9/20, 10:07 - Neerav IPBA: Batch 5
8/9/20, 10:07 - Neerav IPBA: Ignore
8/9/20, 10:08 - Surupa IPBA: I too have not received any such mail.
8/9/20, 10:10 - Tultul IPBA: Yeah. This is for batch 5
8/9/20, 10:10 - Surupa IPBA: Okay
8/9/20, 11:00 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Oh Batch 5 has come... I thought we were the junior mostüòú

8/9/20, 12:59 - Srikanth IPBA: Haha. I got that email too. I got a similar email earlier too. This jigsaw portal is so messed up. From B5, I think they started some discussion forums. I hardly see any activity over there
8/9/20, 13:07 - Rajashekhar IPBA: We have B3 files and videos uploaded to portal similarly

8/11/20, 09:24 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Nah
8/11/20, 09:25 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: I dont know if jigsaw is delaying or what??
8/11/20, 09:31 - Amit Chopra IPBA: No
8/11/20, 09:34 - Siddharth IPBA: This message was deleted
8/11/20, 11:20 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Anyone has 9th Aug codes?
8/11/20, 11:38 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Guys anyone remember how the value of split in a feature was decided in decision tree?? I mean how was the value of 35 was decided in the age variable in example explained by Jitender??
8/11/20, 11:44 - Amit Chopra IPBA: I think it‚Äôs hit and trial, it depends on the gini score or purity. 1st split should be as pure as possible
8/11/20, 11:46 - Dr Kalyan Parimi IPBA: The difference or variance between the split also plays major role as far as I remember, the more it is, much better it would be.
8/11/20, 11:53 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Ok now Gini value is used to select best variable for split...but split on which value of that variable is not explained... or can we say that for every value of the each variable it first compares the maximum variance and then concludes the best value on which split will happen in that variable,  and then compare the gini values if each best spit value of all variables??
8/11/20, 11:59 - Sourabh Patil IPBA: Kind of
But it not check for all the values like 35.1,35.2,35.3
It checks value such as 30,35,40 or  30,32,33 at specific intervals for fast processing
8/11/20, 12:14 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Information gain

8/11/20, 19:33 - Dr Kalyan Parimi IPBA: [19:20, 11/08/2020] Dr. Kalyan Parimi: Regarding, project, if we dont give any topic until Aug ending, it would indicate that IIM would be assigning us a project right
[19:26, 11/08/2020] Moses Kola IIM Indore: If we assign project we will create a group
[19:27, 11/08/2020] Moses Kola IIM Indore: If u get project u can create your own group
[19:28, 11/08/2020] Dr. Kalyan Parimi: Projects given by you, can you let me know if its in partnership with firms or random datasets or well-researched datasets?
[19:29, 11/08/2020] Moses Kola IIM Indore: Partnership with firms
[19:29, 11/08/2020] Moses Kola IIM Indore: Both
8/11/20, 19:33 - Dr Kalyan Parimi IPBA: I hope this thread gives you guys more clarity on what to expect.
8/11/20, 19:35 - Kajal IPBA: Thank you
8/11/20, 19:36 - Srikanth IPBA: I wonder how good are these ‚Äùpartnerships with firms‚Äù. Anyone tried contacting previous batch students regarding this?

8/11/20, 20:41 - Srikanth IPBA: Thanks akshay. This is helpful
8/12/20, 08:26 - Rajashekhar IPBA: After a brief correspondence, I got tableau for students license from tableau
8/12/20, 08:26 - Rajashekhar IPBA: They insisted on id card initially
8/12/20, 08:58 - Rajashekhar IPBA: They also gave elearning portal access for 1 year
8/12/20, 08:59 - Srikanth IPBA: What reason did you give when they asked you to an id?
8/12/20, 08:59 - Rajashekhar IPBA: I gave the jigsaw portal screen
8/12/20, 09:00 - Rajashekhar IPBA: And said we are connecting online owing to Covid
8/12/20, 09:00 - Rajashekhar IPBA: And we cannot get id cards anytime soon
8/12/20, 09:00 - Rajashekhar IPBA: This will get rejected by default
8/12/20, 09:00 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Then we shall mail to support requesting the same.
8/12/20, 09:04 - Srikanth IPBA: Lol. Great workaround
8/12/20, 09:06 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Its tableau and tableau prep as well for 2 computers for an year
8/12/20, 09:08 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Moreover their learning module, though basic costs about 1200$, which is great for Tableau certification
8/12/20, 09:08 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Tableau is entirely GUI so.. barely takes a week and half to be certification ready
8/12/20, 09:19 - Srikanth IPBA: What is tableau prep?
8/12/20, 09:19 - Rajashekhar IPBA: ETL tool for tableau
8/12/20, 09:20 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Just saw it on YouTube seems pretty easy and GUI based as well
8/12/20, 09:29 - Siddharth IPBA: Yep
8/12/20, 09:30 - Srikanth IPBA: Oh ok. Btw attach offer letter when asked. I got confirmation email in 15 min
8/12/20, 09:31 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Awesome the whole process took me 7 daysüòë
8/12/20, 09:32 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Let me know if you are starting off with tableau
8/12/20, 09:34 - Srikanth IPBA: I know basic Tableau. But I guess I'll start from the beginning.
8/12/20, 19:09 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Guys Anyone here who knows how to work on Github
8/12/20, 19:40 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Git hub.. What do you want in it?
8/12/20, 19:46 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: This message was deleted
8/12/20, 19:49 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: I was trying to learn GitHub.. if someone can take a VC session... as how to use.. I know there are lot of youtube videos but in case if we have somebody who works on GitHub it would be quick and easy to understand....üòä
8/12/20, 20:51 - Rajashekhar IPBA: I too learned recenly
8/12/20, 20:51 - Rajashekhar IPBA: However I never collaborated

8/12/20, 21:45 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Thanks Broüôèüèº
8/12/20, 22:20 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Firstly install git and github on your PC
8/12/20, 22:20 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Git bash needs commands
8/12/20, 22:20 - Rajashekhar IPBA: But GIT GUI is pretty straight forward
8/13/20, 00:46 - Susandeep IPBA: Anybody has tried here https://www.coursera.org/programs/iit-indore-7qnfs
8/13/20, 07:57 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: IDs still not active I guess...

8/17/20, 21:07 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: Can‚Äôt get rid of it
8/17/20, 22:33 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Check your y test and probs 
Both should contain only one variable...means only one column
8/17/20, 22:34 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: How?
8/17/20, 22:35 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: I m not getting
8/17/20, 22:35 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: If I am not wrong are you working on HR_data??
8/17/20, 22:35 - Sukanta Ex IPBA: Right
8/17/20, 22:37 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Ok then check how many columns are there in y_test
8/17/20, 22:37 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Run the code y_test.columns
8/17/20, 22:38 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Then check probs should be a one dimensional array...

8/18/20, 16:50 - Surupa IPBA: Have we discussed Gradient Boosting in class?
8/18/20, 16:59 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: I don‚Äôt think so
8/18/20, 17:21 - Babi IPBA: I seek couple of topics under machine learning in JLC which were not covered by Jitendra
8/18/20, 17:21 - Babi IPBA: Basically different methods
8/18/20, 17:22 - Babi IPBA: JLC also talks about covering deep learning and neural networks but Jitendra skipped it
8/18/20, 17:25 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: I guess because all the important things comes under ‚Äú*self learning*‚Äù
8/18/20, 17:26 - Romita IPBA: Did we covered naive byse again in ml ? As they mentioned will be covered during ml
8/18/20, 17:52 - Rajashekhar IPBA: They said naive bayes is not important as we do not have assignment on it üòë
8/18/20, 17:54 - Manasi IPBA: üòÇ

8/20/20, 12:47 - Sourabh Patil IPBA: For tuning the hyperparameters which value is needed? 
Accuracy or ROC
8/20/20, 14:41 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: This u r asking for which model 
Like for classification roc can be used, for regression accuracy can be used ..
For bagged tree out of box error can be used...
8/20/20, 14:44 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Just run a loop and keep fitting different hyper parameters and keep returning the roc or oob error or accuracy value as per your model... the one you choose....
8/20/20, 14:44 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: The best one you choose*
8/20/20, 15:04 - Sourabh Patil IPBA: Classification

8/21/20, 17:39 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Guys 
Which of the ensemble models allows to calculate feature importance method??
8/21/20, 17:41 - Amit Chopra IPBA: I think random forest
8/21/20, 17:43 - Debraj Saha IPBA: All
8/21/20, 17:43 - Debraj Saha IPBA: Bagging, random n also boosted
8/21/20, 17:59 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: A bagging based classifier is not giving any option of feature_importances_
8/21/20, 17:59 - Debraj Saha IPBA: Yeah, Jitendra did in some other way
8/21/20, 17:59 - Debraj Saha IPBA: Not directly
8/21/20, 18:00 - Raj Gaurav IPBA: Jlc has it
8/21/20, 18:00 - Debraj Saha IPBA: Anyways we won't be using bagging classifoer
8/21/20, 18:09 - Debraj Saha IPBA: It was through .estimators_ method
8/21/20, 18:26 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Ya thanks üôèüèº
8/21/20, 21:54 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Guys do we have Jitender‚Äôs code of K means clustering??

8/22/20, 16:12 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: Filtered one should be
8/22/20, 16:12 - Manasi IPBA: yes. filtered one only. they have said to go in sequential order
8/22/20, 16:12 - Preeti IPBA: See this must be right as it is taking about function which we created on filtered data
8/22/20, 16:12 - Saurabh Darda IPBA: It's 118.33

8/26/20, 10:43 - Srikanth IPBA: Can some hardware geek please help me select a gpu for my existing laptop? 

Current Configuration:

Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5500U CPU @2.40 GHz
RAM: 16 GB
It came with a GeForce GTX 850M graphics card. I don't think it has a dedicated memory. 

Does adding a GPU to laptop help boosting performance? 

Thanks!
8/26/20, 11:01 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Depends upon the application running
8/26/20, 11:02 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Few applications leverage GPU as well instead of. CPU
8/26/20, 11:02 - Rajashekhar IPBA: But overall looks a good configuration
8/26/20, 11:03 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Unless you are taking this for. Gaming
8/26/20, 11:03 - Rajashekhar IPBA: In that case a better GPU is preferred
8/26/20, 11:12 - Srikanth IPBA: Thanks for the reply. Not gaming. I'm upgrading it for deep learning. Some people suggested buying a new desktop instead. I wanted to check if some components can be upgraded on my laptop. I read it's not possible to replace/upgrade gpu that came with laptop. Is that right?
8/26/20, 11:12 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Nope upgrade won't be possible
8/26/20, 11:16 - Srikanth IPBA: Oh ok
8/26/20, 11:18 - Srikanth IPBA: Thoughts on adding an external gpu?
8/26/20, 11:19 - Rajashekhar IPBA: You have thunderbolt port with graphics option?
8/26/20, 11:20 - Romita IPBA: You can use Google colabs
8/26/20, 11:20 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Razer laptops had that option for its stealth laptops
8/26/20, 11:20 - Romita IPBA: No need to upgrade laptop

8/29/20, 09:14 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Is there anyway we copy the data to our local machine
8/29/20, 09:18 - Srikanth IPBA: I don't think so. There's a folder assigned for each student. That's your working directory. But before logging out of a session, you should use sync your data. Otherwise, all will be lost. Moses said that he'll organize a short webinar to go through these details

8/31/20, 08:28 - Srikanth IPBA: First time I logged in, I couldn't find it for some reason. Second time, Jupyter popped up in anaconda
8/31/20, 08:29 - Srikanth IPBA: You have to type it after pressing ‚Äùwindows+r‚Äù

8/31/20, 10:46 - Srikanth IPBA: There's a folder on the desktop with your login name. That's your working directory. In order to save, click DataSync on desktop and then SendData to save. I think when you login next time, you need to click GetData. I did not try the full process, but if advice testing with a dummy file before starting the project. Moses was supposed to organize a short webinar to go over this. As usual, nothing happens on time
8/31/20, 11:09 - Pankaj Rana IPBA: Guys anyone on financial services??
8/31/20, 13:40 - Srikanth IPBA: This method does not work. I lost my files.

9/7/20, 16:46 - Amit Chopra IPBA: True
9/7/20, 16:48 - Amit Chopra IPBA: I also rephrased one sentence from Jitendra- *just understand the concept because python code is available over the internet or you can copy the code*. But he had no answer.

One ques, If we enrol before 30th Sept in any course on Coursera using our IIM creds then do we need to pay for the certificate after completing the course if we complete the course after 30th Sept or we need to complete the course before 30th Sep in order to get the certificate free ?
9/21/20, 12:56 - Srikanth IPBA: You have to switch from iim Indore to general portal to access all courses

9/21/20, 13:00 - Srikanth IPBA: Not sure frankly. We have to check with IIM. But one thing I know for sure is you cannot get a free certificate for courses completed before getting access to IIM

10/8/20, 20:49 - Mazhar: If you've got all syntax correct and the module installed, it could mean that your env is corrupt, happens when installation is stopped midway

10/8/20, 20:51 - Ankit Singh IPBA: This message was deleted
10/8/20, 20:51 - Mazhar: Send a screenshot of.your code, maybe someone might help,

Since it is an import error, most likely corrupted package,


Try running 
!pip uninstall utils
And then
!pip install utils
10/8/20, 20:52 - Ankit Singh IPBA: <Media omitted>
10/8/20, 20:52 - Ankit Singh IPBA: This is the file.. try running it.

10/8/20, 21:27 - Mazhar: Alright got it,

10/22/20, 21:31 - Sakshi IPBA: Are they recording the meetings?? I checked with Moses and he told they aren't recording these meetings
10/22/20, 21:36 - Rajesh IPBA: We did see the recording on, mentor confirmed it, but then may he it‚Äôs not getting stored I guess.

10/29/20, 21:19 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Haan their enrollment might have dipped down
10/29/20, 21:19 - Rajashekhar IPBA: They aren't even advertising with news in shorts anymore
10/29/20, 21:19 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Or maybe they are doing

10/30/20, 15:53 - Bharat IPBA: just subscribe to this landing page and check wheather you receive pdf or not
10/30/20, 19:37 - Prasanna IPBA: Seems like a blame game between IIM and jigsaw...
10/30/20, 19:39 - Preeti IPBA: Yes.. seems
10/30/20, 19:39 - Preeti IPBA: But Rajesh I ageee with you.. said very valid point
10/30/20, 19:39 - Mazhar: more like moving the blame onto the students for having irrational expectations!,

"Become an IIM Indore Alum!" was their selling point
10/30/20, 19:40 - Mazhar: 3.5L is the cheapest program out there according to them,

I would have done about 100 projects with edureka and learned 1000 times more with half that money
10/30/20, 19:41 - Preeti IPBA: They shd not guarantee us placement but atleast iim raises the standard .. they shd do something on it
10/30/20, 19:41 - Shankar IPBA: Fact
10/30/20, 19:44 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: Can I know what is happening
10/30/20, 19:44 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: In the call
10/30/20, 19:45 - Swarnapava Ray IPBA: True
10/30/20, 19:45 - Srikanth IPBA: Blame game
10/30/20, 19:46 - Dinesh IPBA: Right, lifting hands
10/30/20, 19:46 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: Ohhhh
10/30/20, 19:46 - Preeti IPBA: Agree
10/30/20, 19:47 - Dinesh IPBA: IIM saying, Jigsaw doing wrong marketing
10/30/20, 19:47 - Kajal IPBA: üò∞üò∞ then what are they doing about it
10/30/20, 19:49 - Dinesh IPBA: Started blame game, IIM saying, it is just allotting a professor for scheduled time
10/30/20, 19:51 - Dinesh IPBA: Very discouraging when we are working on project,  people loose interest
10/30/20, 19:53 - Mazhar: Surupa do you want to kill Himanshu in public for misleading you?
10/30/20, 19:53 - Susandeep IPBA: üòÇ
10/30/20, 20:04 - Rajesh IPBA: I think we don‚Äôt achieve much in these calls - very generic answer as I hear it
10/30/20, 20:04 - Surupa IPBA: NoüòÇüòÇ
But, you know it will be a really great experience for the entire batch
10/30/20, 20:05 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: I agree.. Lost interestüòï
10/30/20, 20:05 - Surupa IPBA: True. Their answers are very general.
10/30/20, 20:05 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: Anybody preparing for Assignment?
10/30/20, 20:06 - Akash Mannari IPBA: Its like an RPA tool (Chat bot)

Ask any questions, you have similar kind of answer
10/30/20, 20:06 - Susandeep IPBA: Haha
10/30/20, 20:06 - Rajesh IPBA: Good one Akash
10/30/20, 20:06 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: Haaha.. Nice one
10/30/20, 20:06 - Avinash IPBA: Lost interest, but paid interest on money taken on loanüòìüòì
10/30/20, 20:06 - Susandeep IPBA: Next Capstone project idea for IIM
10/30/20, 20:06 - Surupa IPBA: Trying to prepare . But not well
10/30/20, 20:07 - Susandeep IPBA: Chatbot for general discussion
10/30/20, 20:14 - Sakshi IPBA: Oh did they mention  this
10/30/20, 20:15 - Sakshi IPBA: I cudnt make up for the call
10/30/20, 20:16 - Dinesh IPBA: Yes, professor Preetham said, jigsaw need to revisit their advertising

10/30/20, 20:29 - Swarnapava Ray IPBA: üòÅüòÅ
10/30/20, 20:30 - Poonam IPBA: üòÇ agreed
10/30/20, 20:45 - Mazhar: However deep in the mess we are, I still ask you to join the placement committee, at least we'll.have some more communication with the shitty placement dept of jigsaw,  if not them then us, we might get at least some success if we band together
10/30/20, 20:46 - Shankar IPBA: Agreed... I think most of us are working professional so we can refer each other within our organisations based on openings if we coordinate well
10/30/20, 20:47 - Mazhar: yes exactly
10/31/20, 11:24 - Rajesh IPBA: While would like to be part of this - I shall personally not be able to give the time that‚Äôs required to do this. Guess people who have time and are persistent would be more apt for this
10/31/20, 11:27 - Kajal IPBA: Hi guys : I am working in Goldman Sachs and have got an email about MANY openings starting nov 15th .... if anyone is interested.. please tell me the division you are looking to enter.

10/31/20, 11:33 - Kajal IPBA: *openings are not necessarily related to data analytics
10/31/20, 11:33 - Suchitra Mayuri IPBA: It‚Äôs ok
10/31/20, 11:33 - Suchitra Mayuri IPBA: I am open for everything
10/31/20, 12:51 - Surupa IPBA: This message was deleted
10/31/20, 12:52 - Surupa IPBA: Me too like to be part of this. But, I think I won't be able to give sufficient time for achieving the best. This would not be fair. So, it would be better if others who can give time come forward.
10/31/20, 17:31 - Preeti IPBA: Interested too
10/31/20, 18:29 - Mazhar: Guys how many here have regularly attended the bigdata classes?

11/1/20, 10:32 - Avi IPBA: üëçüèª
11/1/20, 10:34 - Amit Chopra IPBA: Yes
11/1/20, 10:51 - Sourabh Patil IPBA: Those who attended all the lectures please attempt first
11/1/20, 12:17 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Let‚Äôs start at 2 and divide one question each
11/1/20, 12:18 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Maybe divide and rule may help
11/1/20, 12:19 - Rajashekhar IPBA: Or shall we schedule a zoom call
11/1/20, 12:19 - Rajashekhar IPBA: We discuss and answer first few people
11/1/20, 12:19 - Rajashekhar IPBA: We can improvise on wrong answers as we go further?
11/1/20, 12:20 - Surupa IPBA: Sounds good. But, we should know that questions will be shuffled like earlier MCQ assignments
11/1/20, 12:20 - Surupa IPBA: I feel our WhatsApp group is the better option.
11/1/20, 12:25 - Ritu Batra IPBA: WhatsApp is definitely better , zoom many act as distracting
11/1/20, 12:26 - Surupa IPBA: Right
11/1/20, 12:26 - Ritu Batra IPBA: There maybe 15 questions and we can solve first 5 , dividing who looks for what
11/1/20, 12:27 - Ritu Batra IPBA: Last 5 questions are most of the time difficult and carry more weightage
11/1/20, 12:27 - Ritu Batra IPBA: We can target keeping 30-35 minutes for those
11/1/20, 12:33 - Aditi IPBA: 30 questions are there
11/1/20, 12:35 - Boojashree IPBA: Sure? There are 30?
11/1/20, 12:36 - Saili IPBA: Yes! 30 questions 30 marks

11/1/20, 12:38 - Boojashree IPBA: Also he said , it may take sometime to load the data.. so we have to be quick ..
11/1/20, 12:41 - Boojashree IPBA: First take all the question screen shot and post it.. so all can work on the questions
11/1/20, 12:44 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: 30 questions in 1hr.. what is their expectation?
11/1/20, 12:44 - Mazhar: Possibly easy questions?ü§ûüèª
11/1/20, 12:44 - Poonam IPBA: Revenge
11/1/20, 12:44 - Poonam IPBA: Or punishment
11/1/20, 12:44 - Aparna Saha IPBA: When can we start?
11/1/20, 12:44 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: agree ..there can be a shuffling of questions
11/1/20, 12:44 - Poonam IPBA: Might be the intention.
11/1/20, 12:44 - Poonam IPBA: üòÇ
11/1/20, 12:45 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: lets start at 2
11/1/20, 12:46 - Boojashree IPBA: I think  it is better to start at 1.45 itsef because he gave a heads up telling that it might take some time to load the data.
11/1/20, 12:46 - Boojashree IPBA: And we have exactly one hour to finish
11/1/20, 12:47 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: 3.15 is the finish time ..we will still have 15 mins of buffer if we start at 2
11/1/20, 12:48 - Boojashree IPBA: Okay thenüëç
11/1/20, 12:48 - Shaileshwaram IPBA: <Media omitted>
11/1/20, 12:48 - Aparna Saha IPBA: Ok
11/1/20, 12:49 - Boojashree IPBA: So each question is 1 mark.. so should be easy only I guess.. anyways fingers crossed
11/1/20, 12:51 - Sakshi IPBA: How much is the passing percentage??
11/1/20, 12:51 - Sakshi IPBA: 35%??
11/1/20, 12:51 - Sayan Banerjee IPBA: we need 11 correct answers
11/1/20, 12:54 - Sourabh Patil IPBA: Target 15 üòÖüòÖ
